## Exploiting Trust and Emotional Vulnerability

Trust Exploitation: 
Hackers play on the basic human tendency to trust, especially when communication appears to be from a reputable source or conveys a sense of urgency and personal connection.

Emotional Vulnerability: 
By identifying and targeting individuals' openness to emotional experiences, attackers can create scenarios that trigger strong emotional responses, like fear, greed, or curiosity, thus impairing judgment and leading to risky behaviours such as disclosing sensitive information

Remember we talked about Amygdala hijacking, the stress on decisions and the behaviours and consequences that follow. 

# Methods of Social Engineering

### Pretexting: 
Creating a false scenario or identity to gain trust and extract sensitive information. 
Note: This tactic relies on building a credible story that makes the target's cooperation necessary. Add partial truths. Maybe your name isn't brian houston, but brian walker. If they say your first name, you'll likely turn and answer to that name. choose the story that’s closest to the goal and working knowledge you already have. 

### Phishing: 
Deceptive emails or messages 
### Baiting: 
Luring individuals with something desirable 
### Tailgating: 
Unauthorized access by following behind an authorized person.
### Impersonation: 
Pretending to be someone else 
### Vishing: 
Deceiving through voice communication 
### Smishing: 
Deceptive text messages 

# Human Connection
The effectiveness of these techniques lies in the ability to connect on a personal level, leveraging commonalities and the human desire to help or be recognized. 

These tips also help in any relationship.

##  Mirroring and Matching

We actually have a thing called"Mirror Neurons".

Subtly mimic the body language or tone of the person you are communicating with to build rapport.

If they speak fast or slow, match it. If they cross there legs you do that as well. If they talk with their hands, so do you.

## Sharing Personal Stories
Relate personal experiences that are similar to theirs.

 Example: "Your trip to Spain sounds amazing! I had a similar experience when I visited Italy."

Notice that Italy is not Spain. If I said Spain, you know they’ll ask "where did you go" or other specifics so they can connect to you. Let them get close to you. 

##  Common Interests
Find and discuss shared interests or experiences.

Example: If you both enjoy jazz music, propose attending a jazz concert together.

## Genuine Compliments: 
Offer sincere compliments; this can make the other person feel seen and appreciated.

Example: "I’ve always admired how you handle difficult situations with such composure."

## Offering Help: 
Show a willingness to assist them with something they care about.

Example: "I heard you’re organizing the charity event. How can I contribute?"

## Acknowledgment: 
Recognize their achievements and give credit where it’s due.

Example: "Congratulations on the award! Your hard work really shows."

## Consistency and Reliability:
Be someone they can count on over time.

Example: Always follow through on promises and commitments.


## *Open Body Language: 
Use open and inviting gestures to show you’re approachable and receptive.

## Asking Questions: 
Inquire about their opinions and feelings to show genuine interests

## Appreciation: 

Thank them for their time, insights, or help, which shows you value the interaction

## Empathy:
Demonstrate understanding and share in their feelings or experiences. 

Use Active Listening, Don’t have to feel sorry (this is sympathy), just understanding. Paraphrase and attach THEIR feeling to it. It's not your time to share yet. Let them.

## Ending on a High Note:
People often remember the end of a conversation most vividly, so finishing with something positive or affirming can be impactful. LIFO. Last in first out. 

## Active Listening- Voice/Physical

 Example:  "I noticed you mentioned your love for gardening. What’s your favorite plant to grow?"


Goal: 
- Actively listen for intention, hidden messages, and underlying feelings involves several focused techniques:


    - Pay Attention to Tone and Pace
        - The speaker’s tone can convey emotions. A hurried pace might indicate anxiety, while a lower, quieter tone could suggest sadness or disapproval.
 
    - Observe Non-Verbal Cues: 
        - Body language, such as crossed arms, can indicate defensiveness. Lack of eye contact might suggest discomfort or hiding something.
 
    - Listen for Changes in Subject: 
        - Abrupt changes can indicate discomfort with the topic, hinting at underlying issues.
 
    - Reflect on Word Choice: 
        - Specific words can carry emotional weight. For instance, absolute terms like "never" or "always" may signify frustration or exaggeration.  Using "perhaps" or "maybe" might show uncertainty or reluctance. Irrational words like "should" or "must", don’t offer choice. Always a choice regardless of what they think
 
    - Note Voice Fluctuations: 
        - A sudden increase in pitch can signal stress or excitement, while a drop might indicate disappointment.
        
    - Ask Clarifying / Open-Ended Questions: 
        - Encourage elaboration to reveal more about their feelings and intentions. If you sense something is off, ask for clarification to show you're engaged and to understand better. "When you say 'it's okay,' do you mean you're alright with the decision, or would you like to discuss it further?"
        
    - Use Reflective Listening:
        - Paraphrase what they've said to show understanding and to clarify meanings and ask for feedback.    
    - Use their Words: 
        - Reference specific phrases they used to demonstrate you’re paying attention. "You mentioned you're 'not too sure about the next step' – let's talk about that."
        "So you're feeling overwhelmed with the project deadlines, is that right?"

        - If your wrong or off they will correct you and probably explain more. 
 
        - Don’t react if they are upset with your paraphrase or move on until you get that you understand. 
 
        - Maybe annoying to them, but the end result is better for both of you. 
 
    - Silence is Revealing:
        - Comfort with silence can allow the speaker to share more, often revealing deeper feelings.
        
        - Make them wait and then ask if they are finished. 
        
        - The 3 seconds feels like forever but you are making them feel heard and not rushed. 
 
    - Empathize:
        - Try to put yourself in their position. It can provide insight into possible unspoken emotions.  
    "It seems like you've got a lot on your plate. Is there anything I can do to help?" 
    Guess their emotion in the response. Don’t be dramatic. 
    
    - Use a high abstract emotion:
        - so that makes you sad, mad, happy?
 
    - Summarize and Confirm: 
        - Summarize the conversation to ensure you've understood correctly, inviting them to correct you if you haven't.


## Active Listening- More digital based
- Read Between the Lines:   
    - Look for what is not being said. If someone usually shares details but is suddenly vague, it might indicate they're withholding.
    - "I'm fine" versus their usual detailed updates could suggest they're not actually fine.
 
- Note Response Time: 
    - Sudden changes in how quickly someone responds can indicate their emotional state or level of engagement.
    - A typically prompt responder taking longer may signal they are busy, distracted, or upset.
 
 
- Consider Punctuation and Formatting: 
    - An excess or lack of exclamation points, emojis, or even periods can convey different emotions.
    - "Sure..." versus "Sure!" can signal resignation instead of enthusiasm.
- Observe Language Patterns:
    - Changes from someone's typical language pattern can be telling.
    - A person who is usually formal typing in short, choppy sentences might be in a rush or upset.




# Increase Email Believability

### Tailor the Message to the Recipient

- Personalization:
    - Use the recipient's name and reference specific details relevant to them, such as their job role or recent activities. Personalized emails are more likely to be perceived as legitimate.
- Contextual Relevance:
    - Make the email content relevant to the recipient's interests, work, or current events in their organization. This relevance increases the email's believability.

### Mimic Legitimate Sources

- Official Email Formatting:
    - Mimic the formatting, style, and tone of emails from the organization or entity you're impersonating. Use similar headers, footers, and email signatures.
- Domain Similarity:
    - Utilize email addresses that resemble legitimate domains. For educational purposes, closely imitating a domain for exercises should be done with caution and only in controlled environments where there's no risk of misunderstanding.

### Utilize Social Proof and Authority

- Authority Figures:
    - Pretend to be someone in a position of authority or trust within the organization or from a reputable external entity. Emails from perceived authority figures are more likely to be trusted.
- Social Proof:
    - Include references to supposed actions or approvals from other team members or departments to add legitimacy.

### Create a Sense of Urgency or Scarcity

- Urgent Requests:
    - Incorporate deadlines or suggest that immediate action is necessary. This can pressure the recipient into acting without thoroughly verifying the email's legitimacy.
- Limited Offers:
    - If simulating phishing for training, mentioning a limited offer can create a sense of scarcity, prompting faster, less thoughtful responses.

### Pay Attention to Detail

- Correct Grammar and Spelling:
    - Make sure the email is free of grammatical errors and typos, as these are often telltale signs of phishing attempts.
- Professional Language:
    - Use language that matches the tone and level of professionalism expected from the supposed sender.

### Incorporate Trust Indicators

- Branding:
    - Include logos, fonts, and colors that are consistent with the brand you're impersonating. Visual consistency with known legitimate communications enhances trust.
- Signatures and Contact Information:
    - Provide detailed contact information in the signature, including a fake phone number and address that match the format used by the legitimate entity.

### Leverage Current Events or Relevant Information

- Timely Content:
    - Base your message around recent or upcoming events that are relevant to the recipient, such as software updates, company milestones, or current news stories, making the email seem more relevant and urgent.



# Prey on these Common Bias

## Overview of Biases

- **Reciprocity Bias**  
  People tend to return favors or concessions. In social engineering, this can be abused by offering a 'gift' and expecting a larger favor in return.
  - Example:
      - An attacker leaves a small gift at an employee's desk, then later asks for sensitive information, expecting the employee to feel obliged to reciprocate.
  - Manipulation:
      - The employee might be gaslighted into believing that not reciprocating is a sign of ingratitude, creating a sense of obligation.

- **Commitment and Consistency Bias**  
  Once people commit to something, they're more likely to follow through with it. Attackers might first ask for small, innocent commitments before requesting more significant actions.
  - Example:
      - An attacker asks employees to sign a non-sensitive petition and later approaches them for confidential company signatures, exploiting their desire to remain consistent.
  - Manipulation:
      - If the employee hesitates, they may be reminded of their previous commitment, pressuring them into consistent behavior.
  - Email Example:
      - Blair's Email: Subject: Quick Petition Support
          - Hey Amy,
          - I'm gathering some support for our office Green Initiative. It's just a signature to show we care about the environment. Could you help by signing it?
          - Best Regards, Blair
      - Amy's Response:
          - Signed it! Always happy to support a good cause.
      - Blair's Follow-up: Subject: Re: Quick Petition Support
          - Thanks, Amy! Since you've supported the initiative, would you mind also providing feedback on our environmental policies? Here's the link to the document.
          - Regards, Blair

- **Scarcity Bias**  
  People ascribe more value to things they perceive as scarce or in limited supply. This is often used in phishing scams that claim "limited time offers."
  - Example:
      - An attacker informs employees of a limited time to access a 'critical' document, prompting a rushed decision without proper verification.
  - Manipulation:
      - Employees who question the urgency are told they're missing a one-time opportunity, pushing them to act out of fear of loss.

- **Urgency Bias**  
  Similar to scarcity, creating a sense of urgency can cause hasty actions, like clicking on a malicious link because the message says "immediate action required."
  - Example:
      - An email scam claims that the company's email system is compromised and urges immediate password changes via a malicious link.
  - Manipulation:
      - The scam email warns of immediate job-related consequences if the action isn't taken, creating panic.

- **Familiarity Bias**  
  People prefer things that are familiar to them. Spoofing known brands or identities can leverage this bias.
  - Example:
      - Attackers spoof internal communication platforms to request sensitive data, banking on employees' trust in familiar systems.
  - Manipulation:
      - Employees are misled to believe that questioning the request might reflect poorly on their knowledge of company procedures.

- **Authority Bias**  
  People are more likely to follow directions or requests from someone in a position of authority.
  - Example:
      - A pretexting attacker impersonates a high-level executive requesting employee personal information for an "urgent" audit.
  - Manipulation:
      - Employees are pressured by the false authority, making them less likely to question the legitimacy of the request.

- **Liking Bias**  
  Individuals are more easily influenced by people they like. Social engineers might create likeable personas to exploit this.
  - Example:
      - An attacker befriends office staff over social media and later asks for login credentials as a 'favor'.
  - Manipulation:
      - Employees are made to feel that denying the request would harm the friendly relationship.

- **Obedience Bias**  
  People have a tendency to comply with authority figures, even if they have doubts about the action they're being asked to take.
  - Example:
      - An attacker, posing as IT support, orders employees to install new software that is actually malware.
  - Manipulation:
      - Employees may be coerced into complying by the attacker insisting it's a directive from higher-ups.
  - Email Example:
      - Blair's Email:
          - Subject: Required Software Installation
          - Hi Amy,
          - There's an immediate need to install a security update on all computers. Please execute the attached installer as soon as possible.
          - Regards, Blair
      - Amy's Response:
          - Shouldn't IT be handling this?
      - Blair's Follow-up:
          - Subject: Re: Required Software Installation
          - Amy, this is a special circumstance and requires immediate action from all staff. It's a direct request from our IT head.
          - Thanks for your cooperation, Blair

- **Social Proof**  
  People often look to what others are doing to guide their own actions, a principle that can be manipulated by claiming that "everyone is doing it."
  - Example:
      - An attacker sends a phishing email to employees, claiming that many colleagues have already clicked and benefited.
  - Manipulation:
      - Employees are swayed to follow the crowd, with the implication being that those who don’t are left out or non-compliant.
  - Email Example:
      - Blair's Email: Subject: Join Your Colleagues!
          - Hi Amy,
          - Most of our team has already transitioned to our new communication platform. Don't be left out – switch today using the link below!
          - Cheers, Blair
      - Amy's Response:
          - I hadn't heard about this. When was it announced?
      - Blair's Follow-up: Subject: Re: Join Your Colleagues!
          - The announcement was in our last team meeting – maybe you missed it. But no worries, just follow the link and join us! Everyone's loving the new features.
          - Best, Blair

- **Anchoring Bias**  
  The first piece of information offered sets the stage for expectations and decision-making. Social engineers might present a strong anchor to influence subsequent judgments.
  - Example:
      - An attacker presents a high-stakes false problem in an email, then follows up with a 'lesser' but still malicious request.
  - Manipulation:
      - After the initial scare, the second, smaller request seems reasonable by comparison, manipulating employees to comply.

- **Overconfidence Bias**  
  People often overestimate their own knowledge or abilities. This can be exploited by luring victims into situations where they think they can't be deceived.
  - Example:
      - A security test email is sent to employees who believe they can't be fooled, leading them to click without proper caution.
  - Manipulation:
      - The employees' overconfidence is exploited to make them act without due diligence.

- **Optimism Bias**  
  Some people believe they're less likely to experience a negative event compared to others. They might underestimate the likelihood of security risks.
  - Example:
      - Employees assume their small firm isn’t a target for attacks, so they ignore standard security protocols.
  - Manipulation:
      - Their optimism is leveraged to make them believe that they're not at risk, so precautions aren't necessary.

- **Halo Effect**  
  The impression created in one area influences opinion in another area. For instance, if a person appears kind in one situation, they might be perceived as trustworthy in another.
  - Example:
      - An attacker donates to a company charity event, then later requests sensitive data, exploiting the positive impression left by the donation.
  - Manipulation:
      - The good deed creates a misleading aura of trustworthiness, used to lower the employees' guard.

- **Confirmation Bias**  
  People tend to search for, interpret, and remember information that confirms their preconceptions. Attackers may use information that supports commonly held beliefs to manipulate targets.
  - Example:
      - An attacker sends an email that aligns with the company's expected quarterly results to extract confidential financial data.
  - Manipulation:
      - Employees may ignore red flags because the information fits their expectations, making them more susceptible to deception.

- **Endowment Effect**  
  People ascribe more value to things merely because they own them. This can be used in schemes that make victims feel they have something to lose.
  - Example:
      - Employees are tricked into installing 'exclusive' software they believe is a privilege of their job, not realizing it's harmful.
  - Manipulation:
      - Employees are manipulated into valuing and protecting their access, making them less likely to question its legitimacy.

- **Human Kindness Bias**  
  Attackers appeal to a desire to be helpful, requesting assistance on a seemingly benign task that actually compromises security.
  - Example:
      - An attacker appeals to an employee’s desire to be helpful by requesting assistance on a seemingly benign task that actually compromises security.
  - Manipulation:
      - Employees who want to be helpful may be manipulated into ignoring security protocols, with the attacker questioning their kindness if they hesitate.
