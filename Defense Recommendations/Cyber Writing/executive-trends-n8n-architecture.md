# How CxOs and Multi-Context Architectures Are Shaping Workspaces

Today's CIOs and CTOs face a difficult balance: enabling business agility without letting their infrastructure turn into a maze of unmonitored, interconnected services.

Low-code automation tools like `n8n`, Zapier, and Make.com are being adopted rapidly. These platforms allow users — often without security training — to create multi-step automation flows that interact with internal apps, SaaS platforms, and cloud services.

These tools introduce complexity and shadow workflows: data flows triggered by user activity, email receipts, or webhook callbacks. Many execs are unaware of who can trigger these automations, what data is accessed, and where it's sent.

Workflows become “invisible pipelines” — they span services, transform data, and sometimes authorize actions — all outside traditional IT governance.

This emerging pattern is a new risk surface. Leadership must implement security governance across these platforms: enforce logging, access control, and review of automation logic — because these systems are now part of your enterprise nervous system.
