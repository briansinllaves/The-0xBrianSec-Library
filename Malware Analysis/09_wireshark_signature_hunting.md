# Wireshark: Building Network Signatures

## Objective
Transform static hints (strings, IAT calls) into concrete packet-level signatures you can **hunt** and **alert** on.

## Method
1. From static analysis, extract likely URIs, filenames, or hostnames.
2. Detonate and capture. Use display filters to narrow on candidates:
   - `http.request.full_uri contains "favicon.ico"`
   - `http.request.method == "POST"`
   - `tcp.port == 443 && tls.handshake.extensions_server_name contains "example"`
3. Follow **TCP Stream** to see full request/response context.
4. Record **stable features**:
   - Fixed path components
   - Unique headers (e.g., custom `X-` headers)
   - Specific `Content-Type`/`Content-Length` ranges
5. Check **error handling**: does the sample retry with a distinct pattern when the host is down? That pattern is itself a signature.

## Export & Share
- Use *File → Export Objects → HTTP* to save artifacts for further examination.
- Export selected packets to a **minimal pcap** that reproduces the signature for team sharing.

## Verification
- Re-run detonation to confirm signature is stable across executions and time windows.
- If using INetSim, alter responses (404 vs 200) to observe conditional logic.

## Notes for Defenders
- Process-aware network telemetry (e.g., Sysmon Event ID 3 if available) increases fidelity: tie `Image` + `CommandLine` to the observed flow.


## Additional Analyst Context
Practical malware analysis is not just about observing artifacts in isolation, but about **building narratives**. 
For every string, header anomaly, network request, or parent-child process chain, ask: 
what capability is being enabled, what objective is being pursued, and how does this align to known attacker tradecraft? 
For example, when analyzing persistence, note not just the registry key created but also the attacker’s likely intent 
to survive reboots. When analyzing network traffic, document whether it aligns to a beaconing pattern or a one-time 
file download. Building this contextual storyline turns low-level indicators into actionable intelligence for defenders 
and reproducible techniques for red teams.


## Advanced Perspective
Beyond tactical findings, always consider the **strategic implications** of what you observe. 
A packed binary is not simply an annoyance, it reflects the operator’s OPSEC awareness and desire to resist automated detection. 
A reverse shell connection to a hard-coded IP may reveal a less sophisticated adversary, while beaconing with domain generation 
algorithms implies higher maturity. Disassembly that shows anti-debugging tricks demonstrates both capability and intent to 
delay analysts. By recording these layers of detail, you can not only document what the malware does, but infer the adversary’s 
skill level, resources, and potential affiliations. This elevates your reporting from technical to intelligence-grade insight.
