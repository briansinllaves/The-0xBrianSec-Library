# PEView: Section Headers and File Structure

## Purpose
PEView allows analysts to explore the internal structure of Windows executables (PE format). Section headers reveal insights into whether a binary is normal, tampered, or packed.

## Key Sections
- **.text** – executable code
- **.rdata** – read-only data (IAT often resides here)
- **.data** – read/write global variables
- **.rsrc** – resources such as icons, dialogs

## Workflow
1. Open the binary in **PEView**.
2. Compare:
   - **Virtual Size** (how much space the section takes in memory)
   - **Size of Raw Data** (how much space it takes on disk)
3. If values are drastically different → binary may be **packed**.

## Practical Note
- A legitimate executable usually has fairly aligned section sizes.
- Packed malware often has **tiny raw sizes** but large virtual sizes, signaling that hidden content will be unpacked at runtime.


## Additional Analyst Context
Practical malware analysis is not just about observing artifacts in isolation, but about **building narratives**. 
For every string, header anomaly, network request, or parent-child process chain, ask: 
what capability is being enabled, what objective is being pursued, and how does this align to known attacker tradecraft? 
For example, when analyzing persistence, note not just the registry key created but also the attacker’s likely intent 
to survive reboots. When analyzing network traffic, document whether it aligns to a beaconing pattern or a one-time 
file download. Building this contextual storyline turns low-level indicators into actionable intelligence for defenders 
and reproducible techniques for red teams.


## Advanced Perspective
Beyond tactical findings, always consider the **strategic implications** of what you observe. 
A packed binary is not simply an annoyance, it reflects the operator’s OPSEC awareness and desire to resist automated detection. 
A reverse shell connection to a hard-coded IP may reveal a less sophisticated adversary, while beaconing with domain generation 
algorithms implies higher maturity. Disassembly that shows anti-debugging tricks demonstrates both capability and intent to 
delay analysts. By recording these layers of detail, you can not only document what the malware does, but infer the adversary’s 
skill level, resources, and potential affiliations. This elevates your reporting from technical to intelligence-grade insight.
