# x86 Instructions, Calling Conventions, and the Stack

## Calling Conventions (x86)
- **cdecl**: caller cleans stack; varargs possible. Many compiler defaults.
- **stdcall**: callee cleans stack; common for WinAPI.
- **fastcall/thiscall**: pass some args in registers; used by compilers for optimization.

## Recognizing Prologue/Epilogue
```asm
push ebp
mov  ebp, esp
sub  esp, 0x20   ; local space
...
mov  esp, ebp
pop  ebp
ret  0x10        ; stdcall (callee cleans 16 bytes of args)
```

## Useful Idioms
- `xor eax, eax` to set register to zero (short and fast)
- `lea eax, [ebp-0x10]` to take the address of a local buffer
- `call dword [<imp>Kernel32.CreateFileW]` indicates API use via IAT

## Analysis Patterns
- **Decryption/Decode Loops**: repeated `xor/add/sub/rol/ror` over buffers.
- **Dynamic API Resolution**: hash-based resolver populating function table; look for `LoadLibraryA/GetProcAddress` or equivalents.
- **Process Injection Primitives**: sequences around `OpenProcess/VirtualAllocEx/WriteProcessMemory/CreateRemoteThread` (if unpacked).

## Tips
- Confirm **argument order** on the stack against MSDN to label variables correctly.
- Use cross-refs from strings/structs to land in relevant functions quickly.


## Additional Analyst Context
Practical malware analysis is not just about observing artifacts in isolation, but about **building narratives**. 
For every string, header anomaly, network request, or parent-child process chain, ask: 
what capability is being enabled, what objective is being pursued, and how does this align to known attacker tradecraft? 
For example, when analyzing persistence, note not just the registry key created but also the attacker’s likely intent 
to survive reboots. When analyzing network traffic, document whether it aligns to a beaconing pattern or a one-time 
file download. Building this contextual storyline turns low-level indicators into actionable intelligence for defenders 
and reproducible techniques for red teams.


## Advanced Perspective
Beyond tactical findings, always consider the **strategic implications** of what you observe. 
A packed binary is not simply an annoyance, it reflects the operator’s OPSEC awareness and desire to resist automated detection. 
A reverse shell connection to a hard-coded IP may reveal a less sophisticated adversary, while beaconing with domain generation 
algorithms implies higher maturity. Disassembly that shows anti-debugging tricks demonstrates both capability and intent to 
delay analysts. By recording these layers of detail, you can not only document what the malware does, but infer the adversary’s 
skill level, resources, and potential affiliations. This elevates your reporting from technical to intelligence-grade insight.
