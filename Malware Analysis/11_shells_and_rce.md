# Reverse Shells & Remote Command Execution (Analysis)

## Focus
When a sample yields interactive command execution, analyze **how** it brokers that channel: transport, parent-child lineage, and constraints.

## Indicators & Telemetry
- **Process lineage**: userland interpreters (`cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`) launched by a non-user-initiated parent.
- **Network**: outbound connection from unexpected process to external host/port; consistent keepalive.
- **StdIO redirection**: creation of pipes/handles consistent with shell I/O.

## Lab Method (Safely)
- Observe with Procmon and Process Explorer which process creates the socket.
- Capture PCAP; note the **first SYN** after process launch, remote IP/port, and any protocol headers.
- If the sample connects to your controlled listener, issue **non-destructive** commands (e.g., `whoami`) solely to confirm interactivity and permissions in a safe environment.

## What to Record
- Parent → child chain to the shell broker (e.g., `explorer.exe → mshta.exe → wmiprvse.exe → powershell.exe`).
- Port/protocol, **reconnection logic**, and **time between retries**.
- Any **in-band markers** in the protocol (prompt strings, banners, delimiters).

## Defensive Angle
- Alert on non-shell parent processes spawning a shell with suspicious arguments.
- Combine **Sysmon Event ID 1 + 3** (process create + network connection) to tie execution to egress.


## Additional Analyst Context
Practical malware analysis is not just about observing artifacts in isolation, but about **building narratives**. 
For every string, header anomaly, network request, or parent-child process chain, ask: 
what capability is being enabled, what objective is being pursued, and how does this align to known attacker tradecraft? 
For example, when analyzing persistence, note not just the registry key created but also the attacker’s likely intent 
to survive reboots. When analyzing network traffic, document whether it aligns to a beaconing pattern or a one-time 
file download. Building this contextual storyline turns low-level indicators into actionable intelligence for defenders 
and reproducible techniques for red teams.


## Advanced Perspective
Beyond tactical findings, always consider the **strategic implications** of what you observe. 
A packed binary is not simply an annoyance, it reflects the operator’s OPSEC awareness and desire to resist automated detection. 
A reverse shell connection to a hard-coded IP may reveal a less sophisticated adversary, while beaconing with domain generation 
algorithms implies higher maturity. Disassembly that shows anti-debugging tricks demonstrates both capability and intent to 
delay analysts. By recording these layers of detail, you can not only document what the malware does, but infer the adversary’s 
skill level, resources, and potential affiliations. This elevates your reporting from technical to intelligence-grade insight.
