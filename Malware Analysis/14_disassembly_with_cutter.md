# Disassembling with Cutter (Radare2 Front-End)

## Objective
Use Cutter to statically analyze binaries when you can’t or shouldn’t execute them. Correlate disassembly with imports, strings, and control flow.

## Workflow
1. **Open binary** → let Cutter analyze (AA/AAC passes).
2. **Symbols & Functions**: review imports and auto-detected functions.
3. **Strings**: identify URLs, file names, mutexes, registry paths; cross-reference xrefs.
4. **Graph View**: follow basic blocks, find decision points.
5. **Decompiler View** (if available): confirm intent; don’t over-trust pseudocode.
6. **Xrefs**: from suspicious API (e.g., `URLDownloadToFile`) pivot to callers to see how arguments are built.
7. **Notes/Tags**: annotate discovered capabilities, save the project for repeatability.

## Output
- A map of **capabilities** (download, execute, persistence writes).
- Candidate areas for **breakpoints** if you later choose to debug in a safe lab.


## Additional Analyst Context
Practical malware analysis is not just about observing artifacts in isolation, but about **building narratives**. 
For every string, header anomaly, network request, or parent-child process chain, ask: 
what capability is being enabled, what objective is being pursued, and how does this align to known attacker tradecraft? 
For example, when analyzing persistence, note not just the registry key created but also the attacker’s likely intent 
to survive reboots. When analyzing network traffic, document whether it aligns to a beaconing pattern or a one-time 
file download. Building this contextual storyline turns low-level indicators into actionable intelligence for defenders 
and reproducible techniques for red teams.


## Advanced Perspective
Beyond tactical findings, always consider the **strategic implications** of what you observe. 
A packed binary is not simply an annoyance, it reflects the operator’s OPSEC awareness and desire to resist automated detection. 
A reverse shell connection to a hard-coded IP may reveal a less sophisticated adversary, while beaconing with domain generation 
algorithms implies higher maturity. Disassembly that shows anti-debugging tricks demonstrates both capability and intent to 
delay analysts. By recording these layers of detail, you can not only document what the malware does, but infer the adversary’s 
skill level, resources, and potential affiliations. This elevates your reporting from technical to intelligence-grade insight.
