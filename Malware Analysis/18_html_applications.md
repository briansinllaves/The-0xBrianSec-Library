# HTML Application (HTA) Malware

## Purpose
HTAs are Windows-executable HTML files that run outside the browser context as trusted applications. This makes them powerful phishing payloads.

## Static Analysis
- HTA files contain HTML, CSS, and script blocks.
- Commonly obfuscated with `document.write(unescape(...))` to hide code.
- Deobfuscate with CyberChef (From Hex → Percent delimiter).

## Dynamic Analysis
- Executed by `mshta.exe`.
- Often invoke VBScript/JScript → WMI → PowerShell → payload download.
- Example: Download `jLoader.exe` from attacker domain and execute.

## Key Insight
- Process tree: mshta.exe → wmiprvse.exe → powershell.exe → payload.
- Network: Outbound DNS/HTTP to attacker C2.

## Red Team Insight
HTAs bypass email filters due to being legitimate Windows features. Defenders should monitor mshta.exe usage and block it in enterprise environments.


## Additional Analyst Context
Practical malware analysis is not just about observing artifacts in isolation, but about **building narratives**. 
For every string, header anomaly, network request, or parent-child process chain, ask: 
what capability is being enabled, what objective is being pursued, and how does this align to known attacker tradecraft? 
For example, when analyzing persistence, note not just the registry key created but also the attacker’s likely intent 
to survive reboots. When analyzing network traffic, document whether it aligns to a beaconing pattern or a one-time 
file download. Building this contextual storyline turns low-level indicators into actionable intelligence for defenders 
and reproducible techniques for red teams.


## Advanced Perspective
Beyond tactical findings, always consider the **strategic implications** of what you observe. 
A packed binary is not simply an annoyance, it reflects the operator’s OPSEC awareness and desire to resist automated detection. 
A reverse shell connection to a hard-coded IP may reveal a less sophisticated adversary, while beaconing with domain generation 
algorithms implies higher maturity. Disassembly that shows anti-debugging tricks demonstrates both capability and intent to 
delay analysts. By recording these layers of detail, you can not only document what the malware does, but infer the adversary’s 
skill level, resources, and potential affiliations. This elevates your reporting from technical to intelligence-grade insight.
