# Host Signature Hunting with Procmon & System Artifacts

## Goal
Derive host-based signatures that are **repeatable** and **low-noise** by focusing on specific paths, keys, and creation semantics observed during detonation.

## Steps
1. **Baseline**: Start Procmon before detonation, capture **all events**.
2. **Filter Down**:
   - `Process Name is <sample>` OR the set of observed children.
   - `Operation is CreateFile OR WriteFile OR RegSetValue OR RegCreateKey`
   - `Result is SUCCESS`
3. **Identify Persistence & Artifacts**:
   - Registry: `HKCU\...\Run`, `HKLM\...\Services`, `Root\Subscription` (WMI).
   - Files: new DLL/EXE under `%TEMP%`, `%APPDATA%`, `%PROGRAMDATA%`.
   - Tasks/Services: names, binary paths, arguments, triggers.
4. **Confirm Behavior**:
   - Reboot to validate persistence.
   - Temporarily break egress (INetSim off) to see if self-delete triggers.
5. **Document**:
   - Artifact **path**, **hash**, **creating process**, **first seen time**.
   - Full **command-line** for spawning processes.

## Quick Commands (for confirmation)
```cmd
schtasks /query /fo LIST /v
sc query type= service state= all
wmic /namespace:\\root\subscription PATH __EventFilter get Name,Query
wmic process get ProcessId,ParentProcessId,CommandLine,Name
```

## Output
- A short **IOC pack**: file hashes, paths, reg keys, task/service names, and parent-child chains that can seed detections and IR playbooks.


## Additional Analyst Context
Practical malware analysis is not just about observing artifacts in isolation, but about **building narratives**. 
For every string, header anomaly, network request, or parent-child process chain, ask: 
what capability is being enabled, what objective is being pursued, and how does this align to known attacker tradecraft? 
For example, when analyzing persistence, note not just the registry key created but also the attacker’s likely intent 
to survive reboots. When analyzing network traffic, document whether it aligns to a beaconing pattern or a one-time 
file download. Building this contextual storyline turns low-level indicators into actionable intelligence for defenders 
and reproducible techniques for red teams.


## Advanced Perspective
Beyond tactical findings, always consider the **strategic implications** of what you observe. 
A packed binary is not simply an annoyance, it reflects the operator’s OPSEC awareness and desire to resist automated detection. 
A reverse shell connection to a hard-coded IP may reveal a less sophisticated adversary, while beaconing with domain generation 
algorithms implies higher maturity. Disassembly that shows anti-debugging tricks demonstrates both capability and intent to 
delay analysts. By recording these layers of detail, you can not only document what the malware does, but infer the adversary’s 
skill level, resources, and potential affiliations. This elevates your reporting from technical to intelligence-grade insight.
