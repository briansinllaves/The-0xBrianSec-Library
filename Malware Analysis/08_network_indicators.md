# Network Indicators of Compromise

## Overview
Network telemetry often yields **stable signatures**: domains, URIs, user-agents, and timing profiles. Even when payloads change, protocol fingerprints can remain consistent.

## What to Extract
- **DNS**: queried domains, NXDOMAIN behavior, DGA-like patterns.
- **HTTP/S**: request paths, headers, User-Agent, Accept-Language, cookies.
- **TLS**: SNI, certificate CN/issuer, JA3/JA3S (where available).
- **Cadence**: beacon interval, jitter, backoff strategy, retry logic.

## Workflow
1. Capture traffic with **Wireshark** (or `tcpdump -w sample.pcap`).
2. Filter for sample PID’s sockets using timestamps from Procmon.
3. Identify the **first request** after process start—often the config pull or stage download.
4. If HTTPS obscures content, record **SNI**, **cert metadata**, and timing. In controlled labs you can optionally log TLS keys to decrypt, but **only** in a safe environment.

## Helpful Wireshark Filters
```
dns && ip.addr == <victim-ip>
http.request || http.response
tcp.stream eq <n>
tls.handshake.extensions_server_name
frame.time_relative <= 10.0
```
…and targeted matches like:
```
http.request.full_uri contains "favicon.ico"
```

## Defensive Considerations
- Create detections on **odd User-Agents**, fixed URI paths, non-browser processes issuing HTTP(S).
- Monitor **process → network** correlations (e.g., `mshta.exe` initiating web requests).

## Pitfalls
- Proxies and SSL interception can mask true destinations; log **both** proxy and target when possible.
- Short-lived processes can vanish before you start capture—consider system-wide capture running before detonation.


## Additional Analyst Context
Practical malware analysis is not just about observing artifacts in isolation, but about **building narratives**. 
For every string, header anomaly, network request, or parent-child process chain, ask: 
what capability is being enabled, what objective is being pursued, and how does this align to known attacker tradecraft? 
For example, when analyzing persistence, note not just the registry key created but also the attacker’s likely intent 
to survive reboots. When analyzing network traffic, document whether it aligns to a beaconing pattern or a one-time 
file download. Building this contextual storyline turns low-level indicators into actionable intelligence for defenders 
and reproducible techniques for red teams.


## Advanced Perspective
Beyond tactical findings, always consider the **strategic implications** of what you observe. 
A packed binary is not simply an annoyance, it reflects the operator’s OPSEC awareness and desire to resist automated detection. 
A reverse shell connection to a hard-coded IP may reveal a less sophisticated adversary, while beaconing with domain generation 
algorithms implies higher maturity. Disassembly that shows anti-debugging tricks demonstrates both capability and intent to 
delay analysts. By recording these layers of detail, you can not only document what the malware does, but infer the adversary’s 
skill level, resources, and potential affiliations. This elevates your reporting from technical to intelligence-grade insight.
