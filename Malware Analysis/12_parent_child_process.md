# Parent–Child Process Analysis

## Why It Matters
Malware chains actions through **intermediate processes** to blend with the OS and abuse trust. The tree reveals intent, execution hand-offs, and where to cut the chain.

## Playbook
1. Use **Process Explorer/Hacker** to capture a **tree snapshot** immediately post-detonation.
2. In **Procmon**, pivot on **PID** and **ParentPID** to enumerate each branch.
3. Focus patterns:
   - Office → script host (wscript/cscript) → LOLBin → interpreter
   - `mshta.exe` spawning `wmiprvse.exe` (WMI) which then starts `powershell.exe`
   - Service hosts (`svchost.exe`) launching unexpected binaries

## Fields to Capture (per hop)
- **Image path**
- **Command-line**
- **Integrity level / session**
- **Start time** (correlate to network and file events)

## Defensive Angle
- Detections on **forbidden edges** (e.g., “mshta.exe → powershell.exe”).
- Harden **script hosts** and **mshta.exe** usage policies in enterprise environments where possible.


## Additional Analyst Context
Practical malware analysis is not just about observing artifacts in isolation, but about **building narratives**. 
For every string, header anomaly, network request, or parent-child process chain, ask: 
what capability is being enabled, what objective is being pursued, and how does this align to known attacker tradecraft? 
For example, when analyzing persistence, note not just the registry key created but also the attacker’s likely intent 
to survive reboots. When analyzing network traffic, document whether it aligns to a beaconing pattern or a one-time 
file download. Building this contextual storyline turns low-level indicators into actionable intelligence for defenders 
and reproducible techniques for red teams.


## Advanced Perspective
Beyond tactical findings, always consider the **strategic implications** of what you observe. 
A packed binary is not simply an annoyance, it reflects the operator’s OPSEC awareness and desire to resist automated detection. 
A reverse shell connection to a hard-coded IP may reveal a less sophisticated adversary, while beaconing with domain generation 
algorithms implies higher maturity. Disassembly that shows anti-debugging tricks demonstrates both capability and intent to 
delay analysts. By recording these layers of detail, you can not only document what the malware does, but infer the adversary’s 
skill level, resources, and potential affiliations. This elevates your reporting from technical to intelligence-grade insight.
