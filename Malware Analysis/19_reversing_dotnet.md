# Reversing .NET Malware with dnSpy

## Purpose
Many modern malware families are written in C# or VB.NET. These binaries can be reversed more easily than native executables because they compile into Intermediate Language (IL).

## Indicators
- Strings reveal presence of `mscorlib`.
- PE headers show CLR metadata.

## Workflow
- Load binary into **dnSpy**.
- Inspect IL code and decompile to readable C#.
- Review functions for encryption, network, and persistence.

## Example
- Encrypted C2 configuration embedded in resources.
- Decryption routine recovered and plaintext C2 extracted.

## Red Team Insight
.NET malware is easier to reverse unless obfuscated (ConfuserEx, Agile.NET). Offensive teams must consider obfuscators or custom loaders to avoid trivial analysis.


## Additional Analyst Context
Practical malware analysis is not just about observing artifacts in isolation, but about **building narratives**. 
For every string, header anomaly, network request, or parent-child process chain, ask: 
what capability is being enabled, what objective is being pursued, and how does this align to known attacker tradecraft? 
For example, when analyzing persistence, note not just the registry key created but also the attacker’s likely intent 
to survive reboots. When analyzing network traffic, document whether it aligns to a beaconing pattern or a one-time 
file download. Building this contextual storyline turns low-level indicators into actionable intelligence for defenders 
and reproducible techniques for red teams.


## Advanced Perspective
Beyond tactical findings, always consider the **strategic implications** of what you observe. 
A packed binary is not simply an annoyance, it reflects the operator’s OPSEC awareness and desire to resist automated detection. 
A reverse shell connection to a hard-coded IP may reveal a less sophisticated adversary, while beaconing with domain generation 
algorithms implies higher maturity. Disassembly that shows anti-debugging tricks demonstrates both capability and intent to 
delay analysts. By recording these layers of detail, you can not only document what the malware does, but infer the adversary’s 
skill level, resources, and potential affiliations. This elevates your reporting from technical to intelligence-grade insight.
