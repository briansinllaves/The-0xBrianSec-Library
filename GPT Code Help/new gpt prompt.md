Certainly! Here's an example of how you can describe your needs programmatically using code comments:

```python
# Define the problem statement
"""
I need a program that can calculate the average of a list of numbers.
"""

# Define the input requirements
"""
Input: A list of numbers
- The list can contain both positive and negative numbers
- The list can be of any length
"""

# Define the expected output
"""
Output: The average of the numbers in the list
- The average should be a floating-point number
"""

# Define any constraints or limitations
"""
Constraints:
- The program should handle empty lists gracefully and return 0 as the average
- The program should handle non-numeric inputs and skip them while calculating the average
"""

# Define any additional requirements or preferences
"""
Additional Requirements:
- The program should be efficient and handle large lists of numbers
- The program should be implemented in Python
"""

# Add any other relevant information or context
"""
Context:
- This program will be used in a data analysis project to calculate the average of a dataset
- The program should be reusable and easy to understand
"""

# Feel free to add any other comments or details that you think are important
```

By providing this detailed description, it will help me understand your requirements better and assist you more effectively.
