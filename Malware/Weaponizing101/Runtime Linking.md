# Runtime Linking


## Static vs Runtime vs Dynamic

- Static linking - all code from a library is copied into the resulting program
    - Increased file size that may not be suitable for items such as PE Hollowing
- Dynamic linking - searches for and loads libraries required when program loads
        - Follows the standard windows search order process
- Runtime linking - Load functions from libraries only when the function is needed
    - LoadLibrary/LoadLibraryEx or similar to load the library required. Alternatively, GetModuleHandle can be used if the library is already loaded into memory
    - GetProcAddress/LdrGetProcAddress or similar to get the address of the function
- Runtime linking can be useful to reduce overall size and obfuscate functions from automated analysis (e.g. VirtualAllocEx -> WriteProcessMemory -> CreateRemoteThread)

## Runtime Linking Steps

- Define the prototype for the function you want to use
- Example for WriteProcessMemory:
```
typedef BOOL(__stdcall* writeprocessmemory)(HANDLE, LPVOID, LPCVOID, SIZE_T, SIZE_T);
```

- Get a handle to the library that contains the function you want to load
- Example:
```
std::wcout << "[+] Loading DLL for runtime linking" << std::endl;
HANDLE hModuleHandle = ::LoadLibrary(LPWSTR(L“kernel32.dll”));
if (hModuleHandle == NULL)
{
std::wcout << “[!] LoadLibrary failed” << std::endl;
    return hModuleHandle;
}
return hModuleHandle;
```

- Get the address of the function using GetProcAddress or similar

Example:
```
writeprocessmemory rtlWriteProcessMemory;
rtlWriteProcessMemory = reinterpret_cast(::GetProcAddress(hModuleHandle, LPCSTR("WriteProcessMemory")));
```

Call the function:
```
if (!(*rtlWriteProcessMemory)(hProcess, memory, &scode, sizeof(scode), NULL))
{
…..
}
```
