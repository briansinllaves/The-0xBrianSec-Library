## Slide 4

Windows Error Reporting (WER) 

Trigger file delete primitive to delete C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\WER under the context of system
Create junction point from C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\WER to C:\Windows\System32\Wermgr.exe.local
Run QueueReporting scheduled task under \Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting which in turn follow junction point and create C:\Windows\System32\Wermgr.exe.local under the context of system with write permissions for standard users
Create WinSxS folder structure under C:\Windows\System32\Wermgr.exe.local and drop malicious Comctl32.dll
All subsequent WER report submissions using scheduled tasks or by calling into APIs exposed by WER.dll will try to load WinSxS Comctl32.dll under the context of system
Profit

## Slide 6

Microsoft Installer (MSI)

Trigger file delete primitive to delete C:\Config.Msi under the context of system
Create C:\Config.Msi and place an oplock on it
Start MSI install that have two actions, that is short delay and throwing an error
Once oplock is triggered, use file delete primitive to delete newly MSI created C:\Config.Msi again
Create C:\Config.Msi (last time i promosie) and then replace legitimate rollback script .rbs file with malicious one ( TOCTOU)
MSI installer will pick up malicious .rbs file during the rollback operation and ultimately execute rollback custom actions or move malicious DLL, etc. to system folder
Profit!
