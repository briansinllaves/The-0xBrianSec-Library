# SpeedDev - Malware Builder Framework

## How to Use the SpeedDev Framework

SpeedDev is a modular malware builder framework designed for rapid development, testing, and customization of offensive tooling. Each directory and file represents a reusable component or technique. Here’s how to leverage the framework:

---

### 1. Core Concepts

- **Modularity:** Each `.h` file is a self-contained class or function set for a specific technique (e.g., AV evasion, process injection).
- **Mix & Match:** Combine modules as needed for your payload or implant.
- **Customization:** Edit or extend modules to fit your target environment or OPSEC needs.

---

### 2. Using CodeClasses

#### CPlusPlus

- **AV_Evasion:**  
  Import headers like `av_bypass.h`, `edr_unhook.h`, or `syscall_spoofing.h` to add anti-AV/EDR features.  
  Example:  
  ```cpp
  #include "AV_Evasion/av_bypass.h"
  #include "AV_Evasion/syscall_spoofing.h"
  // Use provided functions to patch AV hooks or spoof syscalls.
  ```

- **Crypto:**  
  Use `aes256.h`, `rc4.h`, or `blowfish.h` to encrypt payloads, C2 traffic, or configuration data.  
  Example:  
  ```cpp
  #include "Crypto/aes256.h"
  std::string encrypted = aes256_encrypt(data, key);
  ```

- **Processes:**  
  Use `process_utils.h` and `memory_injection.h` for process enumeration, injection, and thread hijacking.

- **Tokens:**  
  Use `token_impersonation.h` and `privilege_escalation.h` to steal or duplicate tokens for privilege escalation.

---

### 3. Credential Theft

- **lsass_dump.h:**  
  Dump LSASS memory for credential extraction.
- **mimikatz_loader.h:**  
  Reflectively load and execute Mimikatz in-memory.

---

### 4. Defensive Evasion

- **amsi_patch.h:**  
  Patch AMSI in memory to bypass script scanning.
- **edr_hooking.h:**  
  Unhook or patch EDR hooks.
- **process_tampering.h:**  
  Masquerade your process as a legitimate one.

---

### 5. Dumpers & Enumerators

- **Dumpers:**  
  Extract registry hives, clipboard data, or LSASS dumps.
- **Enumerators:**  
  List users, files, or network resources for situational awareness.

---

### 6. Lateral Movement

- Use modules like `remote_process_exec.h`, `dcom_lateral.h`, and `smb_relay.h` to move laterally within a network.

---

### 7. MeoWare (Execution & C2 Automation)

- **PrepareShellcode & ShellcodeEncryptor:**  
  Format and encrypt shellcode for in-memory execution.
- **process_hollowing.h, dll_side_loading.h, memory_loader.h:**  
  Choose your preferred execution technique and call the relevant functions to deploy your payload.

---

### 8. MalwareDevelopment

- **Anti-Analysis:**  
  Detect VMs, sandboxes, or debuggers before executing payloads.
- **API_Obfuscation:**  
  Use indirect syscalls and runtime obfuscation to evade static and dynamic analysis.
- **Binary_Modifications:**  
  Patch binaries, hide PE sections, or rewrite metadata for stealth.
- **DLL_SideLoading:**  
  Hijack trusted DLLs or modify exports for stealthy execution.
- **Network_Traffic_Evasion:**  
  Make C2 traffic look legitimate (HTTP, DNS, TLS) or use covert channels.
- **Process_Injection:**  
  Choose from APC injection, process hollowing, or reflective DLL injection.
- **Shellcode_Obfuscation:**  
  Mask shellcode as images, embed in C++ templates, or add junk bytes.
- **Steganography:**  
  Hide data in images, audio, or documents for exfiltration or staging.
- **String_Obfuscation:**  
  XOR or base64 encode strings to evade YARA and AV.
- **Windows_API:**  
  Dynamically resolve and call Windows APIs for flexibility and stealth.

## Example Workflow

1. **Select Modules:**  
   Decide which features you need (e.g., AV evasion, credential theft, lateral movement).

2. **Include Headers:**  
   In your main C++ project, include the relevant `.h` files.

3. **Initialize & Chain Functions:**  
   Call the functions in logical order (e.g., evade AV → inject shellcode → establish C2).

4. **Customize:**  
   Modify or extend modules as needed for your target or OPSEC.

5. **Build:**  
   Compile your project. The `Builds` directory can be used to store compiled payloads and binaries.

## Tips

- Test each module independently before combining.
- Use obfuscation and encryption modules to evade detection.
- Regularly update modules to keep up with new defenses.
- Document your build process for repeatability.
