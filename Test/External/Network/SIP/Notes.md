SIP works in conjunction with several other protocols that specify the media format and coding and that carry the media once the call is set up. For call setup, the body of a SIP message contains a [Session Description Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Description_Protocol "Session Description Protocol") (SDP) data unit, which specifies the media format, codec and media communication protocol. Voice and video media streams are typically carried between the terminals using the [Real-time Transport Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_Transport_Protocol "Real-time Transport Protocol") (RTP) or [Secure Real-time Transport Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Real-time_Transport_Protocol "Secure Real-time Transport Protocol") (SRTP).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol#cite_note-Johnston-3)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol#cite_note-8)

Every resource of a SIP network, such as user agents, call routers, and voicemail boxes, are identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). The syntax of the URI follows the general standard syntax also used in Web services and e-mail.[9] The URI scheme used for SIP is sip and a typical SIP URI has the form sip:userne@domainne or sip:userne@hostport, where domainne requires DNS SRV records to locate the servers for SIP domain while hostport can be an IP address or a fully qualified domain ne of the host and port. If secure transmission is required, the scheme sips is used

SIP can be carried by several [transport layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_layer "Transport layer") protocols including [Transmission Control Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol "Transmission Control Protocol") (TCP), [User Datagram Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol "User Datagram Protocol") (UDP), and [Stream Control Transmission Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_Control_Transmission_Protocol "Stream Control Transmission Protocol") (SCTP).[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol#cite_note-RFC_4168-13)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol#cite_note-14) SIP clients typically use TCP or UDP on [port numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_number "Port number") 5060 or 5061 for SIP traffic to servers and other endpoints. Port 5060 is commonly used for non-encrypted signaling traffic whereas port 5061 is typically used for traffic encrypted with [Transport Layer Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security "Transport Layer Security") (TLS).

The network elements that use the Session Initiation Protocol for communication are called _SIP user agents_. Each _user agent_ (UA) performs the function of a _user agent client_ (UAC) when it is requesting a service function, and that of a _user agent server_ (UAS) when responding to a request. Thus, any two SIP endpoints may in principle operate without any intervening SIP infrastructure. However, for network operational reasons, for provisioning public services to users, and for directory services, SIP defines several specific types of network server elements. Each of these service elements also communicates within the client-server model implemented in user agent clients and servers

### User agent

A user agent is a logical network endpoint that sends or receives SIP messages and manages SIP sessions. User agents have client and server components. The user agent client (UAC) sends SIP requests. The user agent server (UAS) receives requests and returns a SIP response. Unlike other network protocols that fix the roles of client and server, e.g., in HTTP, in which a web browser only acts as a client, and never as a server, SIP requires both peers to implement both roles. The roles of UAC and UAS only last for the duration of a SIP transaction.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol#cite_note-RFC_3261-6)

A SIP phone is an [IP phone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_phone "IP phone") that implements client and server functions of a SIP user agent and provides the traditional call functions of a telephone, such as dial, answer, reject, call hold, and call transfer.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol#cite_note-Azzedine-16)[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol#cite_note-17) SIP phones may be implemented as a hardware device or as a [softphone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softphone "Softphone"). As vendors increasingly implement SIP as a standard telephony platform, the distinction between hardware-based and software-based SIP phones is blurred and SIP elements are implemented in the basic firmware functions of many IP-capable communications devices such as [smartphones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone "Smartphone").

In SIP, as in HTTP, the [user agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent "User agent") may identify itself using a message header field (_User-Agent_), containing a text description of the software, hardware, or the product ne. The user agent field is sent in request messages, which means that the receiving SIP server can evaluate this information to perform device-specific configuration or feature activation. Operators of SIP network elements sometimes store this information in customer account portals,[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol#cite_note-18) where it can be useful in diagnosing SIP compatibility problems or in the display of service status.
