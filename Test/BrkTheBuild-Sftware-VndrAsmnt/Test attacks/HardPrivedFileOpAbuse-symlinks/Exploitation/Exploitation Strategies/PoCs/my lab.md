```
1. User create folder "C:\Temp\"
2. User wait for a new file with file extension ".out" to be created in that folder.
3. User recheck compliance status. The process "SecureConnector.exe" creates output file "C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Local\Temp\fstmpsc_<USER>\<RANDOM>.out" during compliance check.
4. User set OpLock on that output file once the file was created
5. The process "SecureConnector.exe" attempt to remove the output file after it finishs the compliance check
6. The process "SecureConnector.exe" will be paused due to the OpLock
7. When OpLock is triggered, user move all files in "C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Local\Temp\fstmpsc_<USER>" to somewhere else to empty the folder
8. User create junction "C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Local\Temp\fstmpsc_<USER>" to "\RPC Control"
9. User create symbolic link "GLOBAL\GLOBALROOT\RPC Control\<RANDOM>.out" to target file (e.g., C:\Windows\System32\secrets.txt)
10. User release OpLock
11. User delete symbolic link
12. Target file (e.g., C:\Windows\System32\secrets.txt) would be deleted
