 you can create junction points (a type of mount point) that effectively "junction" or link folders together. This tool allows you to redirect access from one folder to another at the filesystem level, making it appear as though the contents of the target folder are present in the source folder


```
CreateMountPoint.exe [PathToEmptySourceFolder] [PathToTargetFolder]

```
    [PathToEmptySourceFolder] is the folder where you want to create the mount point. This folder should ideally be empty because its path will be used to access the contents of [PathToTargetFolder].
    
    [PathToTargetFolder] is the destination folder whose contents you want to access through the mount point.
```
CreateMountPoint.exe C:\LinkFolder C:\ActualData

```

When you access C:\LinkFolder, you'll see the contents of C:\ActualData.
