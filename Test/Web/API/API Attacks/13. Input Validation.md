	 Content-Type verification: Send mismatched content-type data, like JSON data with a `Content-Type: text/xml` header.

Test user input for common vulnerabilities (XSS, SQL-Injection, Remote Code Execution).
	
	Command injection test: `api.url.com/endpoint?ne=file.txt; whoami`.

Check for sensitive data in URLs.

Conduct input injections in all parameters.

Locate admin endpoints and try to execute operating system commands, XXE, SSRF, and other injection techniques.

Try execute operating system command 

	Linux :api.url.com/endpoint?ne=file.txt;ls%20/
