Accessing Unauthorized Data

due to missing access control checks, which fail to verify whether a user should be allowed to access specific data.

Change ID in the URL or parameters: `/api/documents/1` to `/api/documents/2` to test for IDOR.

Look for other relevant and relatible objects/data that can you try to access your not expected or authorized to do
