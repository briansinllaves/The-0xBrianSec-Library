Generally speaking, deserialization of user input should be avoided unless absolutely necessary. The high severity of exploits that it potentially enables, and the difficulty in protecting against them, outweigh the benefits in many cases.

If you do need to deserialize data from untrusted sources, incorporate robust measures to make sure that the data has not been tampered with. For example, you could implement a digital signature to check the integrity of the data. However, remember that any checks must take place **before** beginning the deserialization process. Otherwise, they are of little use.

If possible, you should avoid using generic deserialization features altogether. Serialized data from these methods contains all attributes of the original object, including private fields that potentially contain sensitive information. Instead, you could create your own class-specific serialization methods so that you can at least control which fields are exposed.

Finally, remember that the vulnerability is the deserialization of user input, not the presence of gadget chains that subsequently handle the data. Don't rely on trying to eliminate gadget chains that you identify during testing. It is impractical to try and plug them all due to the web of cross-library dependencies that almost certainly exist on your website. At any given time, publicly documented memory corruption exploits are also a factor, meaning that your application may be vulnerable regardless.
