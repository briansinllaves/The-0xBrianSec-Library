Here's a clearer and more structured version of your note:

---

### **PuTTYgen Key Management**

1. **Generate a .ppk File (PuTTY Private Key):**

   - Use **PuTTYgen** to create a `.ppk` file, which is the PuTTY-specific private key format. This key is used for authentication with PuTTY and other tools that support `.ppk`.

2. **Generate a .pub File (OpenSSH Public Key):**

   - The public key generated by PuTTYgen (`.pub`) is in OpenSSH format.
   - This key is meant to be added to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the server where you want to connect.

3. **Generate a .pem File (OpenSSL Private Key):**

   - The `.pem` file is a standard OpenSSL private key format.
   - To connect to servers or clients that require `.pem` format, you can convert your `.ppk` file to `.pem` using PuTTYgen.

   - **Converting `.ppk` to `.pem`:**
     1. Open PuTTYgen.
     2. Load your `.ppk` file.
     3. Go to `Conversions > Export OpenSSH key` and save it as a `.pem` file.

Here's a quick note on setting up a SOCKS proxy in MobaXterm:

### **Setting Up a SOCKS Proxy in MobaXterm**

1. **Open MobaXterm:**

   - Launch MobaXterm on your machine.

2. **Create a New SSH Session:**

   - Go to the top menu and click on `Session`.
   - Choose `SSH` from the session options.

3. **Configure the SSH Session:**

   - In the SSH session settings:
     - **Remote Host:** Enter the IP address or hostne of the server you want to connect to.
     - **Specify Userne:** Enter your SSH userne.
     - **Port:** Ensure the SSH port (default is 22) is correct.

4. **Enable the SOCKS Proxy:**

   - In the same SSH session configuration window:
     - Scroll down to find the **Network Settings** section.
     - Check the box labeled `Dynic Port Forwarding (SOCKS proxy)` to enable the SOCKS proxy.
     - **Set the SOCKS Proxy Port:** You can specify a local port (e.g., 1080) where the SOCKS proxy will listen.

5. **Start the Session:**

   - Click `OK` to save the settings and start the session.
   - MobaXterm will establish an SSH connection to the remote server and start the SOCKS proxy on the specified port (e.g., `127.0.0.1:1080`).

6. **Use the SOCKS Proxy:**

   - Configure your applications or browsers to use `127.0.0.1` with the port you specified (e.g., `1080`) as the SOCKS proxy.
   - Traffic from these applications will now be routed through the SSH connection via the SOCKS proxy.
