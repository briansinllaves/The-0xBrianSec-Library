1. Write a Python script that opens a file called `notes.txt` and writes "This is a test note." to it.
    
2. Extend the script to read the contents of the file and print them.
    
3. Write a script that **reads data** from a CSV file, processes it (e.g., sums a column), and writes the result to another file.
