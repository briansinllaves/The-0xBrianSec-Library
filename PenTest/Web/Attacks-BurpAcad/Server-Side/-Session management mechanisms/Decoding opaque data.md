Burp Suite includes multiple tools for working with opaque data that isn't human-readable. You can use these while you analyze the attack surface, in order to review the information being transmitted and better understand how the application works. For example, you may be able to see whether the opaque data contains any information such as a userne or timestamp, or whether you can edit the opaque data to impact the response.

You can use the following tools to decode and work with opaque data in Burp Suite:

- The Inspector
- Burp Decoder
