### Steps to Find SOAP API or Similar Interfaces

1. **Check for WSDL in the URL:**
   - Append `?wsdl` to the base URL of the website or API to see if it leads to the WSDL (Web Services Description Language) file. Example: `https://example.com/service?wsdl`.

2. **Inspect the Website's Source Code:**
   - Search the source code for terms like "WSDL," "SOAP," or "Web Services."
   - Look for any references to SOAP services, XML nespaces, or WSDL files in the HTML or JavaScript code.

3. **Search Online:**
   - Use search engines to look for WSDL or SOAP references related to the website or API.
   - Example search query: `"website/API ne + WSDL"` or `"website/API ne + SOAP service."`
