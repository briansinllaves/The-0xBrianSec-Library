Limit in repeated requests

	Rate limiting test: Use a script to send rapid requests to `/api/endpoint` and monitor for rate-limiting responses.

Check always HTTPS 
	Ensure all API requests are made over HTTPS and check for SSL/TLS configuration issues.

Check distinct login paths
	Path variation testing: Compare responses from `/api/login` to `/api/v2/login` to `/api/mobile/login`.

Try mobile API versions
	Specifically target and test mobile API endpoints for mobile-specific issues.
	Don't assume developer, mobile and web API is the same, test them separately

Even id is not numeric, try it /?user_id=111 instead /?user_id=user@mail.com
