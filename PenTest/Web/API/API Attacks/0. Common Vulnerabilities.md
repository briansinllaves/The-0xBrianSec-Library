API Exposure
        Identify unexpectedly public APIs through documentation review and network scanning.

Misconfigured Caching
        Inspect cache headers: `Cache-Control: no-store`.

Exposed Tokens
        Search for tokens in HTTP headers, URL parameters, and response bodies.

JWT Weaknesses
        Test for weak signatures: Decode JWT at jwt.io and attempt signature brute-forcing.

Authorization Issues (IDOR, BOLA)
        Attempt to access or modify resources with another user’s ID: `/api/users/123/posts` to `/api/users/456/posts`.

Undocumented Endpoints
        Use tools like Dirbuster or custom scripts to discover hidden API paths.

Different Versions
        Explicitly test each API version for version-specific vulnerabilities.

Rate Limiting (Brute Force Allowed)
        Automate login attempts to test rate limiting: 
        ``
```
for i in {1..100}; do curl -d "userne=test&password=test$i" http://api.example.com/login; done
```


Race Conditions
        Conduct simultaneous requests to exploit race conditions: `curl & curl` with the same request to test for inconsistencies.

XXE Injection
        XXE Payload: 

```
<?xml version="1.0" ?><!DOCTYPE test [<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">]>

```
        
Switching Content Type
        Test JSON to XML conversion vulnerabilities: Change `Content-Type` from `application/json` to `application/xml` with corresponding payload structure.

HTTP Methods
        Check for unauthorized method usage: `OPTIONS, PUT, DELETE` on different endpoints.

Injection Vulnerabilities
        Investigate SQL, Command Injection, LDAP Injection points with payloads like ' OR '1'='1, ; ls, (|).`
