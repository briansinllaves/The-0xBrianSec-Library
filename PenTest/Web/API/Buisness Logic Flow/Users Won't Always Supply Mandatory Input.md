Omitting Expected Parameters

Experiment with removing parameters one at a time and observe responses.

Remove parameters or their values from requests: Omit `user_id` or set `user_id=`.
The server will typically handle both cases differently.

Test both URL and POST parameters, as well as cookies

Follow multi-stage processes through to completion. Sometimes tampering with a parameter in one step will have an effect on another step further along in the workflow
