# Missing File Exploitation

## Description
Some applications attempt to load files (DLLs, EXEs, scripts, configs) that don’t exist. If attackers can place a file with the expected name in a directory the app searches (often writable), they may control execution flow. This is often exploited in services, installers, or startup tasks.

It maps to **MITRE ATT&CK T1574.001** (DLL Hijacking), **CWE-427** (Uncontrolled Search Path Element), and violates **NIST SI-10** and **CM-7** by exposing applications to unmanaged dependencies and improper execution control.

## How to Identify
Use **Procmon** to look for “NAME NOT FOUND” file errors. These indicate the system is searching for a missing file. Correlate this with process privilege and check if the search path includes writable directories.

Check MSI installers, scheduled tasks, or EXE manifests for references to missing resources. Analyze service binaries and their config files to see if any file dependencies can be hijacked.

## Defense Recommendations
Ensure all applications validate the existence and integrity of required files before execution. Avoid relying on search path fallback behavior.

Apply the principle of least privilege and remove write access from directories where sensitive binaries are searched. Use file system monitoring tools to detect new file drops in system directories.

Follow NIST SI-10 by enforcing code integrity checks and ensuring runtime dependencies are validated explicitly. Ensure dev teams use secure coding practices around file loading and configuration handling.
