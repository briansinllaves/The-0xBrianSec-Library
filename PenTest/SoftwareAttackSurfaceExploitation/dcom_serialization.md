# DCOM Serialization Abuse

## Description
DCOM (Distributed Component Object Model) allows software components to communicate over networks. Serialization abuse occurs when a DCOM server deserializes attacker-controlled input without validation. If a DCOM object accepts serialized data through RPC and fails to enforce type or content integrity, arbitrary code execution is possible. This makes DCOM services a target for remote exploitation.

This vulnerability is captured under **MITRE ATT&CK T1048.003** (Exfiltration Over Unencrypted/Non-C2 Protocol), mapped to **CWE-502** (Deserialization of Untrusted Data), and contradicts **NIST SI-10**, which requires strong input validation.

## How to Identify
Enumerate DCOM interfaces using **OleView** or **Dcomperm** to inspect registered objects and permission settings. Use tools like `rpcdump.py` or `Wireshark` to sniff DCOM traffic and locate endpoints receiving serialized input.

Statically analyze DCOM-exposed applications using tools like **dnSpy**, **Ghidra**, or **IDA Pro**. Identify whether .NET or COM components deserialize input via `BinaryFormatter`, `ObjectInputStream`, or unsafe marshalling. Watch for endpoints that don’t enforce authentication.

## Defense Recommendations
Avoid using native binary serialization formats in distributed systems. Validate input type, structure, and origin explicitly before deserialization. Use `KnownType` attributes or safe serializers like `Json.NET`.

Disable unused DCOM interfaces via `dcomcnfg.exe`, and apply registry-based ACLs to limit remote activation. EDRs should alert on suspicious RPC calls involving untrusted DCOM interfaces.

From a compliance standpoint, enforce **NIST SI-10** by validating all remote inputs and adopting secure software development lifecycle (SDLC) practices that address insecure deserialization risks.
