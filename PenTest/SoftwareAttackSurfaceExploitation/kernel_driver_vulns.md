# Kernel Driver Vulnerabilities

## Description
Kernel driver vulnerabilities are flaws in signed drivers that run with high privileges (ring 0). These can include buffer overflows, arbitrary memory writes, information leaks, or allowing userland processes to access privileged functions. Exploiting a vulnerable driver enables attackers to escalate privileges or disable security controls.

Mapped to **MITRE ATT&CK T1068** (Exploitation for Privilege Escalation), **CWE-119**, **CWE-123**, and **CWE-269**, and violates **NIST AC-6**, **SI-10**, and **SI-7**.

## How to Identify
Use tools like **DriverView**, **WinDbg**, or **Ghidra** to inspect loaded drivers and analyze exports. Scan known vulnerable drivers with **Windows Exploit Suggester** or **KDU**.

Monitor driver installation events (`Event ID 6` or `7036`) and check if any drivers expose IOCTLs to user-mode applications. Use fuzzers to test driver interfaces for memory corruption or unvalidated access.

## Defense Recommendations
Remove unused or legacy drivers. Only install drivers from trusted sources and verify digital signatures. Use Device Guard or Windows Defender Application Control to block unsigned or known-bad drivers.

Monitor for unapproved driver installation and access. Audit drivers for dangerous IOCTL handlers. Red team testing and reverse engineering can validate secure memory handling and privilege boundaries.

From a NIST perspective, apply SI-10 for secure coding, SI-7 for software flaw remediation, and AC-6 for privilege restriction. Prevent userland access to privileged driver functions through hardened DSE policy and kernel config.
