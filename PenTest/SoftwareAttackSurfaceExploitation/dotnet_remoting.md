# .NET Remoting Vulnerabilities

## Description
.NET Remoting is a legacy Microsoft framework for inter-process communication. When exposed over the network or local ports, it allows arbitrary object transmission. If remoting objects are not protected with proper access controls and use `BinaryFormatter`, attackers can send malicious data leading to remote code execution.

This attack corresponds to **MITRE ATT&CK T1210**, maps to **CWE-502**, and breaks input handling controls defined in **NIST SI-10**.

## How to Identify
Scan ports for open .NET remoting services (commonly TCP 808, 1234). Analyze processes using `netstat -ab` or reverse application binaries using **dnSpy** to look for `TcpChannel`, `BinaryFormatter`, or `RemotingConfiguration.RegisterWellKnownServiceType` calls.

Use known gadget chains and fuzz input to identify unsafe deserialization or access control bypass.

## Defense Recommendations
Avoid .NET Remoting entirely—it's deprecated and insecure. Migrate to WCF or modern web-based communication protocols with secure bindings.

If still used internally, bind to localhost only, enforce IP whitelisting, and validate all input types. Disable automatic type loading. Apply firewall rules to block untrusted access.

Ensure compliance with **NIST SI-10** and **AC-17** by isolating inter-process communication and validating remote input strictly.
