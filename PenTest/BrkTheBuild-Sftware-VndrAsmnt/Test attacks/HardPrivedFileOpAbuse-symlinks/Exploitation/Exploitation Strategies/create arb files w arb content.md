Let's consider the following behavior for Product X:

Creates log files in C:\ProgramData\Product\Logs (directory with default/inherited access rights)

Logs files are created/written to by both privileged (system) and unprivileged (user) processes

The process that creates the log file sets an explicit ACL so that everybody can write to the file (and rotate it if needed):

-
If we remove existing log files, and turn the Logs directory into a junction to C:\Windows\System32 (thanks to the access rights inherited from C:\ProgramData), the privileged processes of Product X will create their logs in the System32 directory:
-

We can also use the symlink technique to divert a specific log file (e.g. some.log) to create an arbitrary file with an attacker-chosen ne, e.g. a DLL in the program's directory

the privileged process also sets a permissive ACL on the log file, we can also change the content of the file to our liking
