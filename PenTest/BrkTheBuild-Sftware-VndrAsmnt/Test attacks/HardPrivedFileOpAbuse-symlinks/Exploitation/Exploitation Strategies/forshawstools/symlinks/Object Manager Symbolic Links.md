as long as you have access to the target object manager nespace.

it requires SeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege, which by default is only granted to Administrators.

Unprivileged users can create symbolic links in 
	- Windows' Object Manager 
		- manages objects such as processes, sections and files. 
		- uses symlinks for drive letters and ned pipes that are associated with the corresponding devices 

 Users can create object symlinks in writable object directories such as \RPC CONTROL\, and these symbolic links can point to arbitrary paths – including paths on the filesystem – whether that path currently exists or not.


- Windows provide NtCreateDirectoryObject and NtCreateSymbolicLinkObject to create a symbolic link in object manager. 

	- Api's like DefineDosDevice can be used to create a specific dos device object symbolic link(in GLOBAL?? nespace) of a directory.

can’t create  or delete new symlinks under most object directories, such as the \Driver or \Global?? directories

use \RPC Control nespace to put our mount for exploitation.
