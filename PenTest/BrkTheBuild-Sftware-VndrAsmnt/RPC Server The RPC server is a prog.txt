    RPC Server: The RPC server is a program that offers certain functions or services to other programs (clients) over a network or locally.

    Endpoint: An endpoint is not the client but rather the network address (IP address and port) where the RPC server is accessible. It's like a door to the server.

    Interfaces: RPC interfaces define the available services or methods that the server offers. They are similar to header files or a description of the available functions.

    Client Request: When a program (client) wants to use a service offered by the RPC server, it identifies the server's network address, its UUID (a unique identifier), and the specific interface it needs.

    Local or Remote Communication: If the RPC call is local (on the same machine), it may use ncalrpc for fast communication. Otherwise, it uses network protocols like TCP/IP.

    Procedure Call: The client sends an RPC request to the server's specified interface and method (procedure). The request includes the parameters in a specific format.

    Procedure Invocation: The server receives the RPC request, looks up the requested procedure in its interface, and executes the corresponding function based on the index number and format provided in the request.

    Response: The server sends back the result of the procedure execution (if applicable) to the client, which then continues its operation based on the server's response.
