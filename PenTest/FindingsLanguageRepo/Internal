## Legacy Operating Systems
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

**Description:**  
Several systems were running unsupported, outdated Windows OS versions.  

**Business Impact:**  
Unsupported systems cannot receive patches, making them ideal targets for attackers exploiting public or known vulnerabilities. These endpoints are often exploited through published CVEs. They also undermine asset visibility and response strategy. Maintaining them may result in audit or compliance failures.  

**Recommendation:**  
Upgrade or decommission unsupported OSes.  

**Risk Rating:** Medium  
</details>

## Local Administrator Credential Reuse
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

**Description:**  
A single admin password was reused across multiple systems.  

**Business Impact:**  
Reused local admin passwords mean one compromised machine gives access to others, expanding attacker reach and persistence across systems. This allows easy credential replay across the environment. Pass-the-hash and golden ticket attacks become much easier. It breaks network compartmentalization and limits detection.  

**Recommendation:**  
Enforce unique admin passwords per system.  

**Risk Rating:** Medium  
</details>

## NAC Configuration
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

**Description:**  
NAC was bypassed using MAC spoofing of a VoIP phone.  

**Business Impact:**  
MAC spoofing enables NAC bypass, letting rogue devices interact with sensitive systems and bypassing intended access controls entirely. This can lead to unmonitored access to restricted VLANs or infrastructure. Attackers may use this to launch additional exploits or exfiltrate data without detection. It exposes a weakness in physical-to-logical control enforcement.  

**Recommendation:**  
Secure NAC configuration and segment devices lacking cert auth.  

**Risk Rating:** Medium  
</details>

## NetBIOS / LLMNR Spoofing
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

**Description:**  
NetBIOS and LLMNR were active, allowing name spoofing attacks.  

**Business Impact:**  
Name resolution spoofing allows attackers to impersonate systems, redirect traffic, and harvest credentials via relay or MITM attacks. These protocols are frequently abused in internal red team operations. They may be used to poison DNS-like services or confuse endpoint logs. Disabling them significantly increases internal security posture.  

**Recommendation:**  
Disable NetBIOS/LLMNR where not required.  

**Risk Rating:** Medium  
</details>

## NetNTLM v1 Enabled
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

**Description:**  
NetNTLMv1 was enabled for authentication on domain-joined systems.  

**Business Impact:**  
Weak NetNTLMv1 hashes can be cracked offline quickly, exposing valid credentials and expanding attack opportunities within the domain. This outdated protocol lacks sufficient cryptographic protection. Attackers capturing these hashes can convert them to cleartext rapidly. Continued use violates secure baseline standards.  

**Recommendation:**  
Enforce NTLMv2-only auth via Group Policy.  

**Risk Rating:** Medium  
</details>

## Non-Complex Passwords for Privileged Accounts
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

**Description:**  
Privileged accounts used passwords that lacked complexity.  

**Business Impact:**  
Weak privileged account passwords increase likelihood of brute force or dictionary attacks succeeding, compromising high-value targets. These accounts often control access to domain controllers or sensitive systems. Successful compromise can lead to wide-reaching privilege escalation. It severely weakens defense-in-depth and identity security.  

**Recommendation:**  
Apply and enforce strong password policies.  

**Risk Rating:** High  
</details>

## Password Reuse for Privileged User Account
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

**Description:**  
Privileged and standard accounts reused the same passwords.  

**Business Impact:**  
Password reuse across privilege tiers allows escalation from basic accounts to admin systems if one set of credentials is leaked or guessed. Once one credential is exposed, attackers can try it across services and access levels. This breaks isolation between trust levels. It violates best practices for account management and security hygiene.  

**Recommendation:**  
Educate users and enforce separation of credentials.  

**Risk Rating:** High  
</details>

## Reversible Encryption Enabled
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

**Description:**  
Reversible encryption was enabled on some domain accounts.  

**Business Impact:**  
Reversible encryption stores credentials in a form that can be directly decrypted, giving attackers cleartext access with minimal effort. This greatly reduces the effort needed to compromise an account. Passwords can be dumped using native OS tools. It represents a critical misconfiguration for credential storage.  

**Recommendation:**  
Disable reversible encryption in Group Policy.  

**Risk Rating:** Medium  
</details>

## Service Permissions
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

**Description:**  
Misconfigured service permissions allowed privilege escalation.  

**Business Impact:**  
Misconfigured service permissions allowed privilege escalation. Adversaries may overwrite executables tied to elevated services and execute their own payloads. This leads to full admin access on affected hosts. It also bypasses UAC and other local protections.  

**Recommendation:**  
Harden service file permissions to prevent tampering.  

**Risk Rating:** High  
</details>

## Unencrypted Sensitive Information
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

**Description:**  
Sensitive data was found unencrypted across multiple storage locations.  

**Business Impact:**  
Sensitive data was found unencrypted across multiple storage locations. Files containing salaries, contracts, or credentials were accessible to unauthorized users. Such data could be stolen or modified without detection. This increases the risk of breach, compliance failure, and financial loss.  

**Recommendation:**  
Encrypt sensitive data and implement access controls.  

**Risk Rating:** Medium  
</details>

## Unpatched Critical Vulnerability (MS17-010)
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

**Description:**  
A system was vulnerable to MS17-010 (EternalBlue).  

**Business Impact:**  
Exploitation of MS17-010 allows full system compromise, lateral movement, and deployment of ransomware or credential dumping tools. It is a commonly used exploit in the wild and remains effective in unpatched environments. Attackers can establish persistence quickly. Its presence indicates poor patch management and threat awareness.  

**Recommendation:**  
Apply MS17-010 patch (KB4013389) immediately.  

**Risk Rating:** High  
</details>

## Weak Domain Password Policy
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

**Description:**  
Weak password policy allowed trivial passwords on domain accounts.  

**Business Impact:**  
Trivial passwords reduce security for the domain overall. Accounts may be compromised by password spraying or brute force attacks. Weak policy settings encourage user complacency. This allows attackers to compromise services with little resistance.  

**Recommendation:**  
Strengthen password policies and enforce regular testing.  

**Risk Rating:** Medium
