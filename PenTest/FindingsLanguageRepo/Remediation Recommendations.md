### 1. Enforce Data Encryption

Develop and implement policies requiring encryption for all sensitive data at rest. Track and document any exceptions. Ensure employees handling sensitive information understand their role in protecting it.

### 2. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Apply MFA to all critical assets, including VPN gateways, Citrix, and Domain Controllers. This adds a necessary layer of protection against unauthorized access using compromised credentials.

### 3. Enhance Security Awareness Training

Expand CLIENT’s training program with targeted modules covering phishing awareness, password hygiene, social engineering techniques, compliance expectations, and employee responsibilities in safeguarding company assets.

### 4. Improve Password Policy and Management

Implement a password denylist to block common or weak patterns (see Appendix D). Enforce password separation between standard and privileged accounts to reduce the risk of full domain compromise.

### 5. Strengthen Privileged Account Controls

Deploy a Privileged Access Management (PAM) solution. Review all privileged and service accounts to ensure least-privilege access. Enforce strong credentials and an annual rotation schedule.

### 6. Review and Harden Service Accounts

Audit all service accounts across environments. Require strong, unique passwords and rotate them at least annually. Apply strict access controls and establish clear privilege tiering.

### 7. Expand Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

Train development teams on secure coding principles (e.g., OWASP Top 10). Embed security testing throughout the development lifecycle. Require external development partners to meet the same standards and enforce annual security reviews for production applications.

### 8. Address Network Access Control Weaknesses

Restrict the permissions of accounts used by NAC systems to only what is required. Where possible, shift to certificate-based authentication. Segment and isolate devices that cannot meet modern security requirements.

### 9. Harden Network Entry Points

Deploy network-level access controls to prevent unauthorized or unmanaged devices from connecting internally. Monitor and restrict access to unused physical ports and apply dynamic access control policies.

### 10. Segment Critical Infrastructure

Review network segmentation and access controls for both corporate and cardholder environments. Use logical separation to restrict access to high-value targets (e.g., Domain Controllers), and implement jump boxes for secure administrative access.

### 11. Improve SIEM Monitoring and Alerting

Enhance SIEM alert thresholds and event correlation rules to detect lateral movement, privilege abuse, and anomalous behavior. Regularly review and test incident response playbooks with penetration testing and red team simulations.

### 12. Strengthen Vulnerability and Patch Management

Improve asset discovery, vulnerability scanning, and patch cycles. Deploy a dedicated Vulnerability Management System (VMS) to detect insecure configurations, outdated software, and unpatched vulnerabilities. Where patching is not possible, apply appropriate compensating controls.

### 13. Secure Sensitive Data Repositories

Conduct a full review of internal file shares and data stores. Identify and protect repositories containing sensitive data (e.g., PII, cardholder data, passwords). Use encryption, access controls, and segmentation. Remove data that lacks a clear business justification.
