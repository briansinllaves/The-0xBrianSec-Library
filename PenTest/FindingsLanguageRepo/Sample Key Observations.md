### 1. Absence of Multi-Factor Authentication

client’s external applications allowed access with only a username and password. PenTester used stolen credentials to access internal resources, highlighting the lack of MFA as a critical external-facing weakness.

### 2. Security Awareness Gaps

189 of 1254 targeted employees interacted with a phishing site controlled by PenTester. Six disclosed valid client credentials, and 3 executed a malicious payload, providing internal access.

### 3. Uncontrolled Physical Network Access

PenTester connected a rogue device to an open Ethernet port and gained access to the internal network. This exposed weaknesses in physical network enforcement.

### 4. Network Access Control Weakness

The NAC solution attempted to authenticate unknown assets using a privileged domain account. PenTester captured the authentication traffic and used it to compromise the Active Directory domain.

### 5. Weak Password Practices

Multiple domain accounts used predictable passwords. Despite meeting policy, PenTester performed a brute-force attack and compromised client accounts.

### 6. Reused and Weak Administrative Credentials

Credential reuse was observed among privileged accounts. A Domain Admin-level service account had a non-compliant, weak password, increasing the risk of privilege escalation.

### 7. Privileged Access Mismanagement

Several service accounts with elevated privileges used weak credentials. One standard user also had local admin rights, violating the principle of least privilege.

### 8. Misconfigured Systems

PenTester exploited configuration flaws to harvest credentials, escalate privileges, and conduct reconnaissance, demonstrating a broad internal attack surface.

### 9. Unencrypted Sensitive Data

Confidential data—including PII, salary info, and deal details—was found unencrypted in file shares, databases, and cloud storage. Access was achieved through a compromised privileged account.

### 10. Inadequate Network Segmentation

Systems within the Cardholder Data Environment (CDE) were directly reachable from the user network. This poor segmentation risks unauthorized access to payment data.

### 11. Limited Threat Detection and Response

PenTester navigated client’s network and accessed sensitive systems without detection. Weak SIEM configuration and monitoring reduced client’s ability to respond to threats.

### 12. Insecure Software Development Lifecycle

Common web application flaws were exploited, indicating inconsistent secure development practices. These vulnerabilities could expose backend systems and sensitive information, including PHI.

### 13. Gaps in Threat and Vulnerability Management

Outdated software, insecure SSL, and misconfigurations were identified. These issues reflect broader gaps in client’s vulnerability management processes and risk-based prioritization.
