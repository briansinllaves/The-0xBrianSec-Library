Cracking Kerberos Service Tickets

The process of cracking Kerberos service tickets and rewriting them to gain access to a targeted service involves exploiting the fact that service tickets are encrypted with the hash (NTLM) of the service account. 

Any domain user can dump hashes from services without needing to obtain shell access to the system running the service.

This allows any domain user to request Kerberos tickets from the Ticket Granting Service (TGS) that are encrypted with the NTLM hash of the plaintext password of a domain user account used as a service account, such as an account used for running an IIS service. This can be done offline, avoiding Active Directory account lockouts.
 
 You need valid credentials inside the domain.
 admin=1 (you may be admin on some host with that being 0?)

Identify Vulnerable User Accounts with SPNs Set Using PowerView


Find DA with SPN set, cmds searches If spn is not null

Or user accounts with spn ( User accounts treated as service accounts by the DC)

Request tgs from that user and bruteforce offline.
