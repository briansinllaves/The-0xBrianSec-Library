### IaaS Security:

- Protect VMs with authentication and access control using Azure policies.
- Use multiple VMs for high availability with availability sets or zones.
- Install antimalware protection to combat malware.
- Manage VM updates using Azure Automation’s Update Management.
- Monitor VM security posture with Microsoft Defender for Cloud.
- Monitor VM performance to prevent resource abuse.
- Encrypt virtual hard disks (VHDs) for data protection.
- Restrict direct internet connectivity to VMs.

### PaaS Security:

- Shift to identity as the primary security perimeter.
- Develop applications using Azure App Service for web and mobile apps.
- Install a web application firewall (WAF) for centralized protection against vulnerabilities.
- Enable Azure DDoS Protection for enhanced defense against DDoS attacks.
- Monitor application performance for health and availability.
- Conduct regular security penetration testing to validate defenses.

###SaaS Security: 

- involves ensuring that the service provider implements robust security measures, such as data encryption, secure authentication methods, and compliance with relevant regulations.
- Organizations should regularly review the security policies of the SaaS provider to ensure they align with their own security requirements. 
- Additionally, it is important to establish governance policies for data access and sharing within SaaS applications, ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive information. 
- Regular security assessments and user training can further enhance the security posture when utilizing SaaS solutions.
