The Well-Architected Framework is Microsoft's guidance for designing and operating high-quality workloads in Azure. While the Cloud Adoption Framework guides your _journey_ to the cloud and Azure landing zones provide the _foundation_ for your environment, the Well-Architected Framework focuses on _workload excellence_—ensuring each application you build meets quality standards.

These three frameworks work together:

- **Cloud Adoption Framework**: Defines your cloud strategy and adoption approach
- **Azure landing zones**: Implements a secure, governed environment aligned with CAF principles
- **Well-Architected Framework**: Guides the design of individual workloads deployed into your landing zones

For cybersecurity architects, this means CAF's Secure methodology shapes your overall security strategy, landing zones enforce baseline security controls, and the Well-Architected Framework's Security pillar guides workload-specific security decisions.
