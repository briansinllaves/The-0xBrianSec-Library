## The five pillars of architectural excellence

|Pillar|Description|Security architect focus|
|---|---|---|
|**Reliability**|Resiliency, availability, and recovery|Ensure security controls don't create single points of failure|
|**Security**|Data protection, threat detection, and mitigation|Protect confidentiality, integrity, and availability|
|**Cost Optimization**|Cost modeling, budgets, and reducing waste|Right-size security investments for risk level|
|**Operational Excellence**|Holistic observability and DevOps practices|Integrate security into deployment pipelines|
|**Performance Efficiency**|Scalability and load testing|Ensure security controls don't become bottlenecks|

## The Zero Trust foundation

The security pillar is built on Zero Trust principles that every cybersecurity architect should internalize:

- **Verify explicitly**: Authenticate and authorize based on all available data points, including identity, location, device health, and data classification.
- **Use least-privilege access**: Limit access with just-in-time (JIT) and just-enough-access (JEA) policies, risk-based adaptive policies, and data protection.
- **Assume breach**: Minimize blast radius and segment access. Verify end-to-end encryption and use analytics for threat detection and defense improvement.

These principles apply whether you're securing traditional applications, infrastructure, or emerging AI workloads.

## Assessment and continuous improvement

The framework includes the [Azure Well-Architected Review](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/assessments/?id=azure-architecture-review&mode=pre-assessment), a self-assessment tool that evaluates your workload against pillar checklists. For AI workloads, a dedicated [AI workload assessment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/assessments/ea306cce-c7fa-4a2b-89a6-bfefba6a9cf4) addresses the unique considerations of generative and discriminative AI systems.

The framework also integrates with [Azure Advisor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/advisor/), which provides personalized recommendations based on your deployed resources. Azure Advisor scores aggregate recommendations into actionable items categorized by pillar, helping you prioritize security improvements alongside other architectural concerns.
