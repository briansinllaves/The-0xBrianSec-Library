The Cloud Adoption Framework consists of these different methodologies:

- **Strategy**: Align cloud adoption initiatives to measurable business goals and ROI targets.
- **Plan**: Create a comprehensive, stakeholder-aligned plan for cloud transformation.
- **Ready**: Deploy enterprise-ready Azure environments that scale securely.
- **Adopt**: Deploy production workloads in Azure that deliver business value.
- **Govern**: Maintain enterprise control, compliance, and cost optimization.
- **Secure**: Protect workloads against evolving cyber threats and vulnerabilities.
- **Manage**: Ensure operational excellence and continuous optimization.

Each methodology listed above is part of a broad cloud adoption lifecycle. The foundational methodologies (Strategy, Plan, Ready, Adopt) execute sequentially to build enterprise-grade Azure foundations, while the operational methodologies (Govern, Secure, Manage) run in parallel throughout your cloud lifecycle to ensure sustained success and operational excellence.

## AI security within the CAF

AI workloads create new attack surfaces that traditional security measures can't fully address. You must integrate AI-specific security considerations into your cloud adoption strategy, planning, and operations to protect these valuable assets.

AI security activities across CAF phases include:

- **Strategy**: Define AI security objectives and responsible AI principles
- **Plan**: Assess AI skills gaps and plan for AI-specific security controls
- **Ready**: Prepare secure AI infrastructure and establish AI security baselines
- Vv These Loop vV
- **Adopt**: Implement AI security controls during model deployment
- **Govern**: Establish AI governance policies and risk management
- **Manage**: Monitor AI systems for threats and maintain AI security posture
