When implementing an end-to-end Zero Trust framework for visibility, automation, and orchestration, we recommend you focus first on these **initial deployment objectives**:

**I.** Establish visibility.  
**II.** Enable automation.

After these are completed, focus on these **additional deployment objectives**:

**III.** Enable additional protection and detection controls.
