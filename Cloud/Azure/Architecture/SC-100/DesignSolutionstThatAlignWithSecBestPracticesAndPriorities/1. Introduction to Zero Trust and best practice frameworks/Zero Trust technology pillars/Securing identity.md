**Before an identity attempts to access a resource, organizations must:**

- Verify the identity with strong authentication.
- Ensure access is compliant and typical for that identity.
- Follows least privilege access principles.

Once the identity has been verified, we can control that identity's access to resources based on organization policies, on-going risk analysis, and other tools.

### Identity Zero Trust deployment objectives

When implementing an end-to-end Zero Trust framework for identity, we recommend you focus first on these initial deployment objectives:

**I.** Cloud identity federates with on-premises identity systems.  
**II.** Conditional Access policies gate access and provide remediation activities.  
**III.** Analytics improve visibility.
**IV.** Identities and access privileges are managed with identity governance.  
**V.** User, device, location, and behavior is analyzed in real time to determine risk and deliver ongoing protection.  
**VI.** Integrate threat signals from other security solutions to improve detection, protection, and response.
