## Microsoft Security Adoption Framework

SAF provides the “why and how” of security modernization (the strategic roadmap and operational guidance), while MCRA provides the "what" (the detailed architecture of security capabilities).

SAF sets the vision and process for modernizing security, and MCRA gives you the picture of the end-state architecture to aim for, ensuring that your security program’s execution aligns with Microsoft’s best-practice architecture for cybersecurity
