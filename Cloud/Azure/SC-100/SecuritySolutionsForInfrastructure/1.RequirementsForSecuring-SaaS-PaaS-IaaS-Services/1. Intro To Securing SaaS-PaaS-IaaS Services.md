Protect VMs by using authentication and access control

Use [Azure policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/overview) to establish conventions for resources in your organization and create customized policies. Apply these policies to resources, such as [resource groups](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview). VMs that belong to a resource group inherit its policies.

Security becomes less about defending your network and more about defending your data, as well as managing the security of your apps and users. The key difference is that you want to push security closer to what's important to your company. Treat identity as the primary security perimeter
