[Design privileged role assignment using the Enterprise Access Model - Training | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/design-solutions-secure-privileged-access/2-enterprise-access-model)
## Design privileged role assignment and delegation

When designing a solution for assigning and delegating privileged roles, apply these principles from the Enterprise Access Model:

|Principle|Design consideration|
|---|---|
|**Separation of duties**|No single account should have privileges across multiple planes. A user managing the control plane shouldn't use the same account for data plane access.|
|**Just-in-time activation**|Privileged roles should require explicit activation with time limits, rather than permanent assignment.|
|**Approval workflows**|High-impact roles like Global Administrator should require approval from another privileged user before activation.|
|**Scope limitation**|Assign roles at the minimum scope necessary. Use administrative units in Microsoft Entra ID to limit scope of directory roles.|
|**Emergency access**|Maintain break-glass accounts with permanent Global Administrator access, protected with unique credentials and physical security tokens.|

## Evolution from the legacy AD tier model

The enterprise access model supersedes and replaces the legacy tier model that was focused on containing unauthorized escalation of privilege in an on-premises Windows Server Active Directory environment.

The enterprise access model incorporates these elements as well as full access management requirements of a modern enterprise that spans on-premises, multiple clouds, internal or external user access, and more.

### Tier 0 scope expansion

Tier 0 expands to become the control plane and addresses all aspects of access control, including networking where it is the only/best access control option, such as legacy OT options

### Tier 1 splits

To increase clarity and actionability, what was tier 1 is now split into the following areas:

- **Management plane** – for enterprise-wide IT management functions
- **Data/Workload plane** – for per-workload management, which is sometimes performed by IT personnel and sometimes by business units

This split ensures focus for protecting business critical systems and administrative roles that have high intrinsic business value, but limited technical control. Additionally, this split better accommodates developers and DevOps models vs. focusing too heavily on classic infrastructure roles.

### Tier 2 splits

To ensure coverage for application access and the various partner and customer models, Tier 2 was split into the following areas:

- **User access** – which includes all B2B, B2C, and public access scenarios
- **App access** – to accommodate API access pathways and resulting attack surface
