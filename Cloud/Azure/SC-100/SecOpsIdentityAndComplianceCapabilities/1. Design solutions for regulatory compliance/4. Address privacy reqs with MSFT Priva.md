Microsoft Priva is a dedicated privacy solution separate from the compliance and data protection capabilities in Microsoft Purview. While Purview focuses on data security and compliance broadly, Priva specifically addresses privacy operations:

|Priva Solution|Purpose|Privacy Requirements Addressed|
|---|---|---|
|**Privacy Risk Management**|Identify and remediate privacy risks|Data minimization, purpose limitation, transfer restrictions|
|**Subject Rights Requests**|Fulfill individual data requests|Access rights, deletion rights, portability rights|
|**Privacy Assessments**|Evaluate privacy impact of projects|Privacy by design, impact assessments|
|**Consent Management**|Track and manage user consent|Consent requirements, preference management|

These solutions work together to create a comprehensive privacy operations program that addresses regulatory requirements from CCPA, LGPD, and other privacy laws.


# **Design your privacy risk management strategy around three key risk scenarios:**

### Data overexposure policies

Personal data becomes a privacy risk when it's accessible to more people than necessary. Data overexposure policies detect when personal data is stored in locations with overly broad access permissions.

Design your overexposure policies to:

- Identify content containing personal data that is publicly accessible or shared broadly within the organization
- Configure remediation actions that empower content owners to restrict access
- Send user notifications with links to your organization's privacy training materials
- Tag items for privacy team review when automated remediation isn't appropriate

### Data transfer policies

Moving personal data across organizational boundaries, departments, or geographic regions creates compliance risk. Data transfer policies monitor for these movements and alert when transfers violate your privacy policies.

When designing transfer policies, consider:

- **Geographic boundaries** - Detect transfers between regions with different privacy laws, such as data moving outside the EU
- **Departmental boundaries** - Monitor transfers between business units that shouldn't share certain personal data categories
- **External sharing** - Identify when personal data leaves your organization through email or file sharing

### Data minimization policies

Organizations accumulate personal data over time, and retaining data longer than necessary increases privacy risk. Data minimization policies identify personal data that has been stored beyond a defined period without being accessed.

Design minimization policies that:

- Set retention thresholds aligned with your data retention schedule and regulatory requirements
- Notify data owners to review and delete unnecessary personal data
- Generate reports showing aging personal data across your environment

## Designing for subject rights requests

Privacy regulations grant individuals the right to request access to, deletion of, or portability of their personal data. These subject rights requests require organizations to locate all personal data about an individual and respond within regulatory timeframes—often 30 to 45 days.

Priva Subject Rights Requests automates this process.

### Automated data discovery

When you create a request, Priva immediately searches across Exchange Online, SharePoint, OneDrive, and Teams to find content containing the data subject's personal data.
