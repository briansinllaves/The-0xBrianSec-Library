always verify _all_ endpoints

That includes not only contractor, partner, and guest devices, but also [apps](https://aka.ms/ZTApplications) and devices used by employees to access work data, regardless of device ownership.

the same security policies are applied regardless of whether the device is corporate-owned or personally-owned through bring your own device (BYOD); whether the device is fully managed by IT, or only the apps and data are secured. The policies apply to all endpoints, whether PC, Mac, smartphone, tablet, wearable, or IoT device wherever they are connected, be it the secure corporate [network](https://aka.ms/ZTNetwork), home broadband, or public internet.

## **initial deployment objectives**:

**I.** Endpoints are registered with cloud identity providers. In order to monitor security and risk across multiple endpoints used by any one person, you need [visibility](https://aka.ms/ZTCrossPillars) in all devices and access points that may be accessing your resources.  

**II.** Access is only granted to cloud-managed and compliant endpoints and apps. Set compliance rules to ensure that devices meet minimum security requirements before access is granted. Also, set remediation rules for noncompliant devices so that people know how to resolve the issue.  

**III.** Data loss prevention (DLP) policies are enforced for corporate devices and BYOD. Control what the user can do with the data after they have access. For instance, restrict file saving to untrusted locations (such as local disk), or restrict copy-and-paste sharing with a consumer communication app or chat app to protect data.

**IV.** Endpoint threat detection is used to monitor device risk. Use a single pane of glass to manage all endpoints in a consistent way, and use a SIEM to route endpoint logs and transactions such that you get fewer, but actionable, alerts.

**V.** Access control is gated on endpoint risk for both corporate devices and BYOD. Integrate data from Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, or other Mobile Threat Defense (MTD) vendors, as an information source for device compliance policies and device Conditional Access rules. The device risk will then directly influence what resources will be accessible by the user of that device.
