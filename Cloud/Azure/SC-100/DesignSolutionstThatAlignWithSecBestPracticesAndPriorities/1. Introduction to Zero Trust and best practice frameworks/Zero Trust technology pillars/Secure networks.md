**I.** Network segmentation: Many ingress/egress cloud micro-perimeters with some micro-segmentation.  
**II.** Threat protection: Cloud native filtering and protection for known threats.  
**III.** Encryption: User-to-app internal traffic is encrypted.
**IV.** Network segmentation: Fully distributed ingress/egress cloud micro-perimeters and deeper micro-segmentation.  
**V.** Threat protection: Machine learning-based threat protection and filtering with context-based signals.  
**VI.** Encryption: All traffic is encrypted.
