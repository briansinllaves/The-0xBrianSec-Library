Three core elements of a data protection strategy are:

1. **Know your data** - If you don't know what sensitive data you have on-premises and in cloud services, you can't adequately protect it. You need to discover data across your entire organization and classify all data by sensitivity level.
2. **Protect your data and prevent data loss** - Sensitive data needs to be protected by data protection policies that label and encrypt data or block over-sharing. This ensures only authorized users are able to access the data, even when data travels outside of your corporate environment.
3. **Monitor and remediate** - You should continuously monitor sensitive data to detect policy violations and risky user behavior. This allows you to take appropriate action, such as revoking access, blocking users, and refining your protection policies.

As a baseline, you need to define labels, discover sensitive data, and monitor the use of labels and actions across your environment

 **initial deployment objectives**:

**I.** Access decisions are governed by encryption.  
**II.** Data is automatically classified and labeled.
**III.** Classification is augmented by smart machine learning models.  
**IV.** Access decisions are governed by a cloud security policy engine.  
**V.** Prevent data leakage through DLP policies based on a sensitivity label and content inspection.
