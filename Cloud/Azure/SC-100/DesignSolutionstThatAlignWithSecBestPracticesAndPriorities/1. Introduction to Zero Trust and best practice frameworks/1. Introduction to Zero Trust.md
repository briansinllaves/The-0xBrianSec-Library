You can find best practices for adopting a Zero Trust approach to security throughout the Microsoft Cybersecurity Reference Architecture (MCRA) and Microsoft cloud security benchmark (MCSB).

Microsoft Zero Trust approach to security is based on three principles: assume breach, verify explicitly, and least privilege.

"never trust, always verify."
## Guiding principles of Zero Trust

- Verify explicitly - Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points.
    
- Use least privilege access - Limit user access with Just-In-Time and Just-Enough-Access (JIT/JEA), risk-based adaptive policies, and data protection.
    
- Assume breach - Minimize blast radius and segment access. Verify end-to-end encryption and use analytics to get visibility, drive threat detection, and improve defenses.
