The Microsoft Cybersecurity Reference Architecture (MCRA) and Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark (MCSB) provide best practices for each threat category.

### Insider threat protection

Insider threats originate from individuals with legitimate access—employees, contractors, or partners—who intentionally or accidentally cause harm. Key risks include data leaks, intellectual property theft, fraud, and compliance violations. Key practices include:

- **Implement least privilege access**: 
	- Restrict access to only what users need for their role. Use just-in-time access for sensitive operations and conduct regular access reviews. _MCSB Controls: PA-1 (limit privileged users), PA-7 (just enough administration), IM-2 (protect identity systems)._
- **Monitor user behavior**: 
	- Deploy user entity behavioral analytics (UEBA) to detect anomalous activity patterns such as unusual data access, off-hours activity, or bulk downloads. _MCSB Controls: LT-1 (threat detection), LT-2 (identity threat detection)._
- **Protect sensitive data**: 
	- Classify and label sensitive data, apply data loss prevention (DLP) policies to prevent unauthorized sharing, and use encryption to protect data at rest and in transit. _MCSB Controls: DP-1 (discover and classify data), DP-2 (monitor sensitive data), DP-3 (encrypt in transit)._
- **Enforce separation of duties**: 
	- Require multiple approvals for critical actions such as financial transactions, code deployments, or access changes. _MCSB Controls: PA-1 (separate privileged users), GS-3 (define roles)._

### External attack protection

External attacks originate from threat actors outside your organization—cybercriminals, nation-states, or hacktivists. Effective defense requires balanced investments across the full attack lifecycle: identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover. Key practices include:

- **Deploy layered defenses**: 
	- Combine preventive controls (firewalls, endpoint protection, access controls) with detective controls (SIEM, XDR) across all attack surfaces. _MCSB Controls: NS-1 (network segmentation), ES-1 (endpoint detection), LT-1 (threat detection)._
- **Integrate XDR and SIEM**: 
	- Use extended detection and response (XDR) for high-fidelity alerts on covered assets, and SIEM for broad visibility and correlation across all data sources. Neither alone provides complete coverage. _MCSB Controls: LT-1 (threat detection), LT-5 (centralize logs), IR-3 (create incidents from alerts)._
- **Automate response with SOAR**: 
	- Use security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) to reduce manual effort, accelerate containment, and free analysts for complex investigations. _MCSB Controls: IR-6 (automate incident handling), IR-4 (investigate incidents)._
- **Prepare incident response**: 
	- Document incident response (IR) plans with clear roles, playbooks, and communication procedures. Conduct regular tabletop exercises and post-incident reviews. _MCSB Controls: IR-1 (IR preparation), IR-2 (incident notification), IR-7 (post-incident review)._
- **Adapt for OT environments**: 
	- Adjust tools and processes for operational technology constraints—prioritize safety, use passive network detection, and isolate legacy systems that can't be patched. _MCSB Controls: NS-1 (segmentation), LT-4 (network logging)._

### Supply chain attack protection

Supply chain attacks compromise trusted vendors, software, or services to gain access to your environment. These attacks are particularly dangerous because they bypass traditional perimeter defenses. Key practices include:

- **Verify software integrity**: 
	- Validate code signatures, checksums, and software bills of materials (SBOM) before deployment. Monitor for tampering in CI/CD pipelines. _MCSB Controls: DS-2 (software supply chain security), DS-6 (secure DevOps lifecycle)._
- **Assess third-party risk**: 
	- Evaluate vendor security practices before onboarding. Include security requirements in contracts and conduct periodic reassessments. _MCSB Controls: GS-1 (security strategy), GS-6 (third-party risk)._
- **Limit third-party access**: 
	- Apply least privilege to vendor accounts and service connections. Use dedicated accounts with time-limited access and monitor all third-party activity. _MCSB Controls: PA-6 (privileged access workstations), PA-8 (cloud provider access), IM-7 (conditional access)._
- **Isolate external integrations**: 
	- Segment networks and systems that connect to third parties. Use API gateways with security controls for external service integrations. _MCSB Controls: NS-1 (segmentation), NS-2 (secure cloud services), AM-2 (approved services)._
