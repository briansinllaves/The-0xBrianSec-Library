## Microsoft Security Adoption Framework

SAF provides the “why and how” of security modernization (the strategic roadmap and operational guidance), while MCRA provides the "what" (the detailed architecture of security capabilities).

SAF sets the vision and process for modernizing security, and MCRA gives you the picture of the end-state architecture to aim for, ensuring that your security program’s execution aligns with Microsoft’s best-practice architecture for cybersecurity

## MCRA

The [Microsoft Cybersecurity Reference Architectures (MCRA)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/adoption/mcra) describe Microsoft's cybersecurity capabilities and how they integrate with existing security architectures. The MCRA provides:

- **Technical diagrams** showing how Microsoft security capabilities integrate with Microsoft platforms (Microsoft 365 and Azure), non-Microsoft applications (ServiceNow, Salesforce), and non-Microsoft cloud platforms (AWS, GCP).
- **Capability descriptions** with ScreenTips that provide brief explanations and links to documentation when viewing in presentation mode.
- **Best practice guidance** for implementing security capabilities across your enterprise environment.

The MCRA helps you understand how Microsoft capabilities work together to help you achieve your end-to-end security goals. The MCRA includes:

- Antipatterns (common mistakes) and best practices
- Threat trends, attack patterns, and the importance of an end-to-end security approach and ruthlessly prioritizing security work
- Guidance for successfully adopting an end-to-end security approach using Zero Trust principles
- Mapping Microsoft capabilities to Zero Trust standards and organizational roles
- Guidance on AI Security
- Detailed diagrams for:
    - Microsoft cybersecurity capabilities
    - Zero Trust user access
    - Security operations (SecOps/SOC)
    - Operational technology (OT)
    - Multicloud and cross-platform capabilities
    - Attack chain coverage
    - Infrastructure and development Security
    - Security organizational functions
- ...and more

### How organizations apply the MCRA

**Compare and assess existing capabilities**
**Define a target security architecture**
**Learn about Microsoft security capabilities**
**Identify integration opportunities**
