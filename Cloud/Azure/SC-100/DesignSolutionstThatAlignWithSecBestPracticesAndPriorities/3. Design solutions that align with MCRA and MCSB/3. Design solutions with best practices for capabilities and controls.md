The following best practices and MCSB controls are technology-agnostic security principles.


### Identity and privileged Access

Identity is the foundation of Zero Trust security. A centralized identity provider serves as the policy engine for access decisions. Key practices include:

- **Centralize identity and enable strong authentication**: Use a single, centralized identity provider. Enforce multifactor authentication (MFA) for all users, block legacy authentication, and use passwordless methods where possible. _MCSB Controls: IM-1 (centralize identity), IM-6 (MFA), IM-7 (conditional access)._
- **Apply conditional access policies**: Evaluate every access request in real time based on user role, device compliance, location, and risk signals. Block high-risk sign-ins and enforce device compliance for sensitive apps. _MCSB Controls: IM-7 (conditional access)._
- **Protect privileged accounts**: Implement least privilege with role-based access control (RBAC), use just-in-time elevation for administrative access, maintain separate admin accounts, and require Privileged Access Workstations (PAWs) for sensitive tasks. _MCSB Controls: PA-1 (protect admin accounts), PA-3 (use PAWs)._
- **Govern and monitor identities**: Automate identity lifecycle with HR integration, conduct regular access reviews, and monitor sign-in anomalies with identity protection and security information and event management (SIEM) solutions. _MCSB Controls: IM-2 (protect identity systems), PA-8 (access review process)._

### Endpoint and device Security

Zero Trust requires continuous verification of device security posture. Key practices include:

- **Enroll devices and enforce compliance**: Manage all corporate devices with a mobile device management (MDM) solution using compliance policies (encryption, patching, antivirus). Use compliance signals in conditional access to restrict access from noncompliant devices. _MCSB Controls: ES-1 (endpoint security), ES-2 (anti-malware)._
- **Deploy Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)**: Deploy EDR solutions on all endpoints for threat detection, automated response, and vulnerability management. Enable tamper protection. _MCSB Controls: ES-1 (EDR solution), ES-3 (anti-malware updates)._
- **Manage updates and vulnerabilities**: Use centralized patch management. Scan for vulnerabilities continuously and enforce application control in high-risk environments. _MCSB Controls: PV-3 (secure configurations), PV-5 (vulnerability assessments)._
- **Protect BYOD and mobile**: Use mobile application management (MAM) policies for personal devices. Apply conditional access session controls via a cloud access security broker (CASB) to limit data downloads on unmanaged devices. _MCSB Controls: ES-1 (endpoint security)._

### Network and infrastructure Security

Network controls remain essential for defense-in-depth and breach containment. Key practices include:

- **Segment and restrict network access**: Use network security groups, subnets, and firewalls to limit lateral movement. Allow only necessary traffic between segments. _MCSB Controls: NS-1 (network segmentation), NS-2 (secure cloud services)._
- **Secure cloud network perimeter**: Use firewalls and web application firewalls (WAF) for traffic inspection. Enable DDoS protection, use just-in-time access for management ports, and enforce TLS for all web apps. _MCSB Controls: NS-4 (firewall and WAF), NS-5 (DDoS protection)._
- **Use private access**: Use private endpoints and service endpoints for PaaS services. Implement Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) instead of legacy VPN for remote access. _MCSB Controls: NS-2 (secure cloud services), NS-3 (private access)._
- **Monitor network traffic**: Analyze network flow logs, enable threat intelligence filtering on firewalls, and monitor DNS for command-and-control (C2) activity. _MCSB Controls: NS-10 (DNS security), LT-1 (threat detection)._

### Application security and DevOps

Applications and Azure pipelines must be secured to prevent vulnerabilities. Key practices include:

- **Secure configuration of cloud services**: Apply security benchmark baseline settings to all cloud services. Use managed identities with least privilege, secure vaults for secrets, and policy enforcement for compliance. _MCSB Controls: PV-2 (secure configurations), AM-2 (managed identities)._
- **Integrate DevSecOps**: Embed static application security testing (SAST), dependency scanning, and secret scanning in CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) pipelines. Enforce code quality gates before deployment. _MCSB Controls: DS-6 (secure DevOps), DS-7 (code scanning)._
- **Protect running applications**: Use a CASB for SaaS monitoring, integrate apps with your identity provider for authentication, and use API management with WAF rules. Deploy container security solutions for Kubernetes workloads. _MCSB Controls: DS-2 (application security), AM-5 (restrict app access)._
- **Secure data in applications**: Enforce data validation, encryption at rest and in transit (TLS 1.2+), and use masking/tokenization for sensitive data. _MCSB Controls: DP-3 (encryption in transit), DP-4 (encryption at rest)._

### Data protection and governance

Security is ultimately about protecting data. Key practices include:

- **Discover and classify sensitive data**: Use data governance tools to scan and classify data across documents, databases, and storage. Apply sensitivity labels to inform access and encryption policies. _MCSB Controls: DP-1 (discover data), DP-2 (classify data)._
- **Encrypt data at rest and in transit**: Use encryption with platform-managed or customer-managed keys and enforce TLS for all connections. Consider confidential computing for highly sensitive workloads. _MCSB Controls: DP-3 (encrypt in transit), DP-4 (encrypt at rest), DP-5 (key management)._
- **Implement data loss prevention (DLP)**: Use DLP policies across email, collaboration tools, file storage, and endpoints to prevent data exfiltration. Block or alert on unauthorized sharing of sensitive data. _MCSB Controls: DP-2 (monitor sensitive data)._
- **Apply least privilege data access**: Use row-level security, column encryption, and sensitivity labels to restrict data access. Monitor data access via database auditing and SIEM integration. _MCSB Controls: DP-2 (classify data), AM-3 (least privilege)._
- **Protect backups**: Enable soft delete on backups, use immutable storage for ransomware protection, and test recovery regularly. _MCSB Controls: BR-1 (backup strategy), BR-2 (protect backup data)._

### Threat detection and response

Assume breach and build robust detection and response capabilities. Key practices include:

- **Centralize logging and monitoring**: Aggregate all logs (identity, device, network, application, cloud service) in a SIEM solution. Use built-in analytics and machine learning to detect anomalies. Retain logs 90+ days with tamper protection. _MCSB Controls: LT-1 (enable logging), LT-3 (centralize logs), LT-4 (network logging)._
- **Enable extended detection and response (XDR)**: Deploy XDR solutions that share signals across endpoints, identity, cloud apps, and email to detect multi-stage attacks. _MCSB Controls: LT-1 (threat detection), IR-2 (preparation)._
- **Establish incident response and automation**: Document incident response (IR) plans with roles and playbooks. Use security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) to automate containment (isolate machines, disable accounts). _MCSB Controls: IR-1 (IR preparation), IR-4 (detection and analysis), IR-5 (response)._
- **Continuous improvement**: Conduct regular red-team/blue-team drills and tabletop exercises. Track Mean Time To Detect/Mean Time To Respond (MTTD/MTTR) metrics and feed lessons learned into improving detection and response. _MCSB Controls: IR-6 (post-incident activity)._
