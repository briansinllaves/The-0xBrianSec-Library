AI platform security focuses on protecting the underlying infrastructure, models, and training data. Key practices include:

- **Use only approved models**: 
	- Deploy AI models only after formal verification through a trusted approval process. Maintain a centralized model registry to track provenance, verification status, and approval history. _MCSB Control: AI-1 (ensure use of approved models)._
- **Protect training data and models**: 
	- Treat AI models and training data as high-value assets. Apply data classification, access controls, and encryption. Prevent unauthorized access to model weights and parameters. _MCSB Controls: DP-1 (discover and classify data), DP-4 (encrypt at rest)._
- **Secure the AI development lifecycle**: 
	- Integrate security into MLOps pipelines. Scan for vulnerabilities in ML frameworks, validate data inputs, and test models for adversarial robustness before deployment. _MCSB Controls: DS-2 (supply chain security), DS-6 (secure DevOps lifecycle)._

### AI application security

AI application security addresses vulnerabilities in application logic, orchestration, and integrations with plugins or external systems. Key practices include:

- **Implement multi-layered content filtering**: 
	- Deploy content validation and filtering across all stages—input prompts, internal processing, and model outputs—to detect and block malicious content, adversarial inputs, and harmful outputs. _MCSB Control: AI-2 (multi-layered content filtering)._
- **Adopt safety meta-prompts**: 
	- Use system instructions to guide AI models toward intended, secure, and ethical behavior. Design meta-prompts that prioritize system instructions over user inputs to resist prompt injection attacks. _MCSB Control: AI-3 (safety meta-prompts)._
- **Apply least privilege for agent functions**: 
	- Restrict the capabilities and access permissions of agent functions or plugins to the minimum required. Use sandboxed execution environments and short-lived, scoped tokens. _MCSB Control: AI-4 (least privilege for agent functions)._
- **Ensure human-in-the-loop**: 
	- Implement human review and approval for critical actions, especially when interacting with external systems or sensitive data. Define high-risk operations that require human validation before execution. _MCSB Control: AI-5 (human-in-the-loop)._

### AI monitoring and response

Continuous monitoring and proactive testing are essential to detect AI-specific threats and validate security controls. Key practices include:

- **Establish monitoring and detection**: 
	- Deploy AI-specific threat detection to monitor model inference, API calls, and plugin interactions. Detect jailbreak attempts, prompt injection patterns, and data exfiltration through AI interactions. _MCSB Control: AI-6 (monitoring and detection)._
- **Perform continuous AI red teaming**: 
	- Proactively test AI systems using adversarial techniques to discover vulnerabilities before attackers exploit them. Simulate prompt injection, jailbreaking, and data poisoning scenarios. _MCSB Control: AI-7 (AI red teaming)._
- **Integrate threat intelligence**: 
	- Correlate monitoring data with AI-specific threat intelligence frameworks like MITRE ATLAS and OWASP Top 10 for LLM to identify known attack patterns. _MCSB Controls: AI-6 (monitoring), LT-1 (threat detection)._
