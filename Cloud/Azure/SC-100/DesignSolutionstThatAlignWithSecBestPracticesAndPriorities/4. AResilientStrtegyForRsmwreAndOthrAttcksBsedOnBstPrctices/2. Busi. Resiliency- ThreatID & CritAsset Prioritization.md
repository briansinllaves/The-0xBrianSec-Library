## Identifying and prioritizing threats to business-critical assets

Key steps include:

1. **Identify business-critical assets**: Work with business stakeholders to determine which systems, data, and processes are essential for maintaining operations. Consider both customer-facing services and internal capabilities. In modern organizations, this increasingly includes:
    
    - AI and machine learning systems that support business decisions
    - AI-powered customer service and support systems
    - Predictive analytics platforms
    - Automated business process systems
2. **Assess threats and vulnerabilities**: For each critical asset, identify the most likely and impactful threats:
    
    - Ransomware and extortion attacks
    - Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks
    - Data breaches and exfiltration
    - Insider threats
    - Supply chain compromises
    - AI-specific threats (model poisoning, prompt injection, training data exfiltration)
    - Natural disasters and infrastructure failures
3. **Prioritize based on business impact**: Evaluate threats based on:
    
    - Likelihood of occurrence
    - Potential business impact (financial, operational, reputational, regulatory)
    - Time to recover
    - Complexity of mitigation
4. **Map controls to threats**: For each prioritized threat, identify specific security controls and recovery capabilities:
    
    - Preventive controls to reduce likelihood
    - Detective controls for early warning
    - Response procedures to contain damage
    - Recovery capabilities to restore operations
5. **Establish recovery objectives**: Define specific Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) for each critical asset based on business requirements, not technical convenience.
