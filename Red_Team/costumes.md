# Costumes, Outfits, and Props for Red Team Engagements

## Why Use Costumes and Props?
- Blending in is critical for physical red team operations.
- The right outfit or accessory can help you avoid suspicion and access restricted areas.

## Sourcing Costumes & Outfits

- **Thrift Stores:** Great for generic business attire, maintenance uniforms, or delivery outfits.
- **Online Retailers:** Amazon, eBay, and specialty uniform shops offer security, janitorial, IT, and contractor uniforms.
- **Workwear Stores:** Purchase high-visibility vests, hard hats, tool belts, and other trade gear.
- **Custom Printing:** Services like Vistaprint or local shops can make fake badges, lanyards, or branded shirts (avoid using real company logos without permission).

## Common Props & Accessories

- **Clipboards, folders, or binders:** Look official and provide a reason to be present.
- **Fake or generic ID badges:** Use badge holders and lanyards to appear as staff or contractors.
- **Tool bags or carts:** Useful for impersonating maintenance or IT staff.
- **Delivery boxes or packages:** Blend in as a courier or mailroom worker.
- **Walkie-talkies, earpieces:** Add authenticity to security or event staff roles.
- **Office supplies:** Carrying pens, notepads, or laptops helps you blend in.

## Tips

- Match your outfit to the environment (business casual, maintenance, delivery, etc.).
- Avoid overdoing it—subtle, generic uniforms are less likely to draw scrutiny.
- Observe real staff for details like color, logos, and accessories.
- Always act confidently and have a cover story ready.

**Note:**  
Only use costumes and props for authorized red team or penetration testing engagements. Never impersonate emergency services or law enforcement.
