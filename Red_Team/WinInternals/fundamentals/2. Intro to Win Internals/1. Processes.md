A process maintains and represents the execution of a program; an application can contain one or more processes. A process has many components that it gets broken down into to be stored and interacted with. The Microsoft docs break down these other components, "Each process provides the resources needed to execute a program. A process has a virtual address space, executable code, open handles to system objects, a security context, a unique process identifier, environment variables, a priority class, minimum and maximum working set sizes, and at least one thread of execution." This information may seem intimidating, but this room aims to make this concept a little less complex.

As previously mentioned, processes are created from the execution of an application. Processes are core to how Windows functions, most functionality of Windows can be encompassed as an application and has a corresponding process. Below are a few examples of default applications that start processes.

  •	MsMpEng (Microsoft Defender)
  •	wininit (keyboard and mouse)
  •	lsass (credential storage)

Attackers can target processes to evade detections and hide malware as legitimate processes. Below is a small list of potential attack vectors attackers could employ against processes,
  •	Process Injection (TI055)
  •	Process Hollowing (TI055.012)
  •	Process Masquerading (TI055.013)
  
  Processes have many components; they can be split into key characteristics that we can use to describe processes at a high level. The table below describes each critical component of processes and their purpose.

We can also explain a process at a lower level as it resides in the virtual address space. The table and diagram below depict what a process looks like in memory.

This information is excellent to have when we get deeper into exploiting and abusing the underlying technologies, but they are still very abstract. We can make the process tangible by observing them in the Windows Task Manager. The task manager can report on many components and information about a process. Below is a table with a brief list of essential process details.

These are what you would interact with the most as an end-user or manipulate as an attacker.

There are multiple utilities available that make observing processes easier; including Process Hacker 2, Process Explorer, and Procmon.

Processes are at the core of most internal Windows components. The following tasks will extend the information about processes and how they're used in Windows.
