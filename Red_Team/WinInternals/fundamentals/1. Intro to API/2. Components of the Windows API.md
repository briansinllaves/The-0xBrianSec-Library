The Win32 API, more commonly known as the Windows API, has several dependent components that are used to define the structure and organization of the API.

Let’s break the Win32 API up via a top-down approach. We’ll assume the API is the top layer and the parameters that make up a specific call are the bottom layer. In the table below, we will describe the top-down structure at a high level and dive into more detail later.
