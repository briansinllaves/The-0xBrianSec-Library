# Lockpicking & Bypass Tips

## Cheap Locks

- Most cheap padlocks and door locks use simple pin tumbler mechanisms.
- These can often be picked quickly with basic tools (tension wrench + hook pick).
- Raking (scrubbing the pins with a rake pick while applying tension) is often effective.
- Many cheap locks can be bypassed with shims or even thin metal strips.

## Using the Tension Wrench (Tensor)

- The tension wrench (tensor) is the most important tool—apply gentle, consistent torque to the lock cylinder.
- Too much tension will bind the pins; too little and the pins will reset.
- Insert the wrench at the bottom or top of the keyway, depending on space.
- While maintaining tension, use your pick to lift pins one by one until the lock opens.

## Door Knob Locks

- Most residential door knobs use pin tumbler locks—pick as above.
- Some can be bypassed with a "credit card" shim if the latch is spring-loaded and not deadlatch.
- For knob locks with a hole on the outside, a small screwdriver or paperclip can sometimes push the release.

## Deadbolts

- Deadbolts are more secure but often use the same pin tumbler mechanism.
- Use a tension wrench and single pin picking or raking.
- Some deadbolts can be bypassed from the inside with a wire tool if there is a gap under the door.
- If the deadbolt is poorly installed, "loiding" (slipping a thin plastic between the door and frame) may work, but this is rare.

## Bike Locks with Numbers (Combination Locks)

- Many cheap combination bike locks can be decoded by feel:
    - Pull tension on the shackle and slowly turn each dial; feel for a slight "give" or click when the correct number is aligned.
    - Work through each dial one at a time.
- Some locks can be bypassed with shims or by prying the lock body.

## Realtor Locks (Lockboxes)

- Realtor lockboxes often use 3- or 4-digit combinations or push-button codes.
- For rotary dials, use the same tension/feel method as bike locks.
- For push-button types, look for worn buttons or try all combinations (there are often fewer than you think).
- Some lockboxes can be bypassed with shims or by prying the latch.

## Office Building Locks

- Many office doors use commercial-grade pin tumbler locks—pick as above, but expect tighter tolerances.
- Some use wafer locks (common in file cabinets)—rake or jiggle with a thin pick.
- Electronic locks may have mechanical override keyways—pick as normal.
- Some doors can be bypassed with latch slip tools ("latch jim" or shove knife) if the latch is not shielded.
- Badge readers: tailgating or using a strong magnet on some older magstripe locks may work, but is rare.

**General Tips:**
- Practice on clear or cutaway locks to learn feedback.
- Always use the lightest tension possible.
- Never force a lock—if it doesn’t open, reset and try again.
- For legal and ethical reasons, only pick locks you own or have explicit permission to test.
