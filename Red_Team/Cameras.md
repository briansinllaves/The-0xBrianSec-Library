# Camera Bypass Tips for Red Teamers

## General Principles

- Cameras are everywhere in modern office buildings: lobbies, elevators, hallways, entrances, and server rooms.
- Assume all footage is recorded and may be monitored live or reviewed later.
- The goal is to avoid identification, minimize time in view, and avoid triggering alerts.

## Types of Cameras & Bypass Techniques

### 1. Fixed Cameras (Dome/Bullet)

- **Stay out of field of view:** Hug walls, use blind spots (directly under or beside the camera).
- **Timing:** Move when the area is busy or when lighting is poor (early/late hours).
- **Disguise:** Use hats, masks, or change appearance (but avoid looking suspicious).
- **Obstruction:** Carry large objects (boxes, umbrellas) to block your face as you pass.

### 2. PTZ (Pan-Tilt-Zoom) Cameras

- **Movement:** Wait for the camera to pan away before moving; observe its pattern.
- **Distraction:** Trigger a distraction elsewhere to draw the camera’s attention.
- **Speed:** Move quickly through the area when the camera is facing away.

### 3. Motion-Activated Cameras

- **Slow movement:** Move slowly and steadily to avoid triggering motion sensors.
- **Distraction:** Send a decoy (object or person) to trigger the camera elsewhere.

### 4. Infrared/Night Vision Cameras

- **Bright lights:** Shine a strong IR LED or flashlight at the lens to "blind" the camera (may be obvious on review).
- **Clothing:** Wear dark, non-reflective clothing to reduce IR signature.

### 5. Doorbell/Intercom Cameras

- **Angle:** Approach from the side or below to stay out of direct view.
- **Obstruction:** Use a clipboard, folder, or phone to obscure your face.

### 6. Wireless/Temporary Cameras

- **Detection:** Use RF detectors to locate hidden wireless cameras.
- **Obstruction:** Tape, stickers, or spray can temporarily block the lens (only if you have authorization).

## Additional Tips

- **Recon:** Scout the building beforehand to map camera locations and coverage.
- **Lighting:** Avoid well-lit areas; shadows and backlighting make identification harder.
- **Timing:** Enter with crowds or during shift changes to blend in.
- **Digital Bypass:** If you have access, disable or loop camera feeds (requires insider access or hacking).
- **Physical Bypass:** Some cameras can be physically unplugged or redirected, but this is risky and may trigger alerts.

**Warning:**  
Tampering with cameras is illegal without explicit authorization. Only perform these actions during authorized red team engagements.
