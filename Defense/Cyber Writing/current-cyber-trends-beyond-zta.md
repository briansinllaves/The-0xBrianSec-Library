# Modern Cybersecurity Trends Beyond Zero Trust

Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) is no longer cutting-edge — it’s the baseline. Current enterprise trends are moving beyond identity enforcement to real-time governance, infrastructure-as-code security, and continuous compliance validation.

In Azure, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) has matured. Security teams are now implementing granular permissions down to specific management actions. Azure Policy is being used to enforce organizational security rules like “only encrypted disks are allowed” or “no public IPs on VMs.” These policies apply at scale across the cloud environment.

Infrastructure is increasingly defined in code — Terraform, Bicep, or ARM templates — which allows security policies to be embedded into deployment pipelines. Organizations are starting to shift from audit-based compliance (yearly checks) to continuous compliance, where rules are enforced at the deployment gate.

Compliance overlays such as FedRAMP, HIPAA, and CMMC 2.0 are now built into policy packs and compliance dashboards. Security isn't just about denying threats — it's about proving you're secure.

These trends show a cultural shift: security is now baked into the engineering lifecycle, not bolted on afterward.
