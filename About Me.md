I'm a seasoned cybersecurity professional with over 7 years of experience in information security. I’ve operated across enterprise and government environments, combining technical depth with operational efficiency.

I bring discipline and mission focus to every project. My background includes internal penetration testing at a Big Four firm and infrastructure hardening for DoD networks, with hands-on expertise in automating STIG evaluation and bringing to compliance, CIS Benchmark conversion to Azure Policy, ACAS scanning, and Forescout engineering.

Currently, I’m pivoting into security leadership roles—aiming to bridge technical execution with executive strategy. My GitBook, The 0xBrianSec Library, captures this journey—documenting real-world offensive tactics, cloud defense, and executive-level security insights.

My future goals include learning more about cloud architecture and business strategy, and leadership. Maybe I will start an MBA and work toward the Harvard Business School CLIMB program—short for Credential of Leadership, Impact, and Management in Business.
